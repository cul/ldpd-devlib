              </header>
            </div>

            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>Two years ago we announced a professional development program in the
  Columbia University Libraries for the Humanities &amp; History Division. In our first
  iteration of the Developing Librarian project or, as we refer to it on social media,
  the #devlib project, our goal was to build a common project using an adaptation
  of <a href="http://praxis.scholarslab.org/">the Praxis model</a> for professional
  librarians. Today, the Developing Librarian team is proud to announce the launch
  of our site, <a href="http://mhdh.library.columbia.edu/">Morningside Heights Digital
  History</a>, or MHDH.</p>

<p>After an initial round of ‘introductions’ to the technologies
  and skills needed to design our site, we divided into teams: design, editorial,
  management and development. For a more detailed breakdown of our different roles,
  please visit our credits page. The project was built on the <a href="http://omeka.org/">Omeka
  platform</a>, using the <a href="http://neatline.org/">Neatline plugin</a> for
  the interactive map and an interactive tour of the Butler Library Mural, and the
  Exhibit Builder for our different exhibits. We chose the Berlin theme, and modified
  it to suit our needs. The research was done individually, but we shared bibliographic
  and archival resources. We documented the process throughout on our Developing Librarian
  blog, where you are now.</p>

<p>When we set out to do this as a team, we wanted to accomplish
  much: to expand our ability to support and consult in digital humanities, to hone
  our research skills, to bridge the gap between IT and subject librarianship, and
  to bond as a team by sharing a common project. We feel we have accomplished all
  of these and more. In particular, we find all aspects of our work as a team have
  benefited from developing a project together. Learning to build consensus around
  difficult issues will have a lasting effect on all we do in the libraries and on
  campus.</p>

<p>We have many people to thank for this project: our technology team and library
  administrators in the Columbia University Libraries, who have seen the importance
  of flexibility in the technical infrastructure for our training efforts. We are
  also appreciative of all the conversations and feedback from colleagues at many
  universities, including the University of Indiana, University of Minnesota, University
  of Virginia, University of Florida, New York University, and Duke University.</p>

<p>Following this first phase of our project, we will continue our professional development through
  a series of targeted training sessions for and by our team and others at Columbia
  University Libraries. We will continue to share what we learn on our blog. We have
  grown as individuals and as a team during the past three years of this project.
  In the next phase, we will expand this model to enhance our own research (for example,
  one team member will be using digital tools to assess variant versions of an unpublished
  play by Tennessee Williams), following a model pioneered by Trevor Muñoz and MITH
  in their Digital Humanities Incubator for libraries. We will also be partnering
  with faculty to create and co-teach digital labs attached to traditional humanities
  courses, to improve our digital pedagogical skills. We have always emphasized process
  over product in this training, but we are excited to share our web exhibit and this
  model for future professional development at Columbia and elsewhere.</p>
