We might add to this list of life's deficiencies: insufficient time and inadequate metadata. In a project such as our digital history of Morningside Heights, however, we do have some control over these last two issues. The Project Management team, working in concert with our other teams, established at the beginning a timeline for what needs to take place and when to insure initial project launch in December 2014. This timeline has been periodically revisited and adjusted by the group as a whole. For our latest revisiting I will be meeting with individual team leaders to make sure that I understand fully all of the items to which deadlines are attached at this point and how they interrelate. Our timeline, as adjusted based on this latest revisiting, will be posted on this blog. In our last group meeting we included some discussion of metadata, following up from an earlier meeting with one of our catalogers that was devoted to the topic. Each time anyone uploads an item to our project site, decisions need to be made and fields filled out in an Omeka template that is based on Dublin Core. Now that the group as a whole is devoting more time to identifying and uploading items, it is key that we arrive at clear agreements on how we are using and interpreting the template. ",

    "content": " It is fascinating to look at the variety of documents connected with the early history of the Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine. The guidebooks and historical accounts are, of course, interesting; but sermons preached there can also be highly revealing of how the meaning of the cathedral was envisioned. William Reed Huntington, an ecumenicist, says in his sermon 'The Talisman of Unity': 'No place could possibly be more appropriate' for an enquiry into the future of 'Church Unity' in the United States 'than this place,' going on to discuss the symbolic resonance of the design for the completed Cathedral (6-7). It is a challenge to think of how to indicate in the metadata why this particular sermon has been included in the online collection. I tried to accomplish this through fields in the Dublin Core metadata, indicating the basic idea of the sermon in the DESCRIPTION and using a relevant Library of Congress Subject Heading (Ecumenical movement--History--Sources) in the SUBJECT field to put the sermon itself in historical context. This raises various questions for me. How will people be approaching this site? How do we ensure that it is something more than an idiosyncratic collection of historical curiosities? I think the answer is that each collection needs to be built with some kind of an overarching narrative in mind of the developing role and significance of the building or institution as it was perceived by people at the time. We are, in some small way, becoming historians, simply by deciding which materials to include. ",

Git is open source software that will allow us to preserve and work on our code in a distributed environment. This afternoon Stuart Marquis discussed Git and Github in CLIO development. He showed how each JIRA ticket from the CLIO development project becomes a commit in Git, and how we are using Git to track version changes and for our release notes. Two other things I learned: The importance of having three versions of our project: a production version, a development version, and a test version. We work in the development instance and then push changes to test, and from test to production. Service Level Agreements define service level expectations and can spell out the consequences of not meeting the agreement. This is important when working with vendors, but it is also important as we work more closely with faculty and others on digital projects or services. These could help us define what we can be expected to offer. ",

    "content": " I enjoyed the variety of interesting tools that are gathered on Bamboo Dirt, but as I browsed around I noticed that many of the tools dealt with audio from the angle of text transcription, oral histories, etc. There are some music-specific tools, but I noticed that there is currently no category for audio (although there is a tag). It's no surprise that these tools tend to be focused on text, but there are several developing tools that work with music notation and audio that I believe belong in such a collection of tools. Here's where the open nature of the tool set in Bamboo Dirt is welcome. I signed up for an account, identified a couple key tools which I thought would be useful to list, and within minutes had my contributions up on the site. I added links for music21, Soundflower, and the Music Encoding Intiative (MEI). I also emailed the admins, asking them about adding 'audio' and 'music' to the categories list. They were very responsive, and promised to include the idea in the next site update. It's important to be able to distinguish between general audio tools and music-specific ones. It's also important to include tools for working with notated music. I wasn't really surprised that music apps didn't have that strong a presence - music often has to play catch-up, and the specialized requirements of music audio and music notation aren't always well-understood. There is a growing field of sound studies and sound art, and work in these areas is increasingly interdisciplinary. I look forward to exploring ways to increase the interoperability of music and sound with other disciplines, and that is one of my personal goals in this project, in gaining experience with other technologies - to learn how to take them back to integrate with projects in music and sound.

If you are familiar with Photoshop -- you will make good use of other basics such as crop tool, blur, dodge, burn, eye-dropper, smudge -- these are all available from Pixlr Editor.

    "content": " At our last group meeting on December 16, 2014, we agreed to a February 2, 2015 launch for the project. This provided what we thought would be adequate time to develop our exhibits. Before, during, and after the holidays there was a lot of activity in our Omeka site – uploading items and exhibits, reviewing options for different layouts, and discovering new questions about our metadata. The work in Omeka was helping us to identify new issues for review. Many of us were finding real benefit in working in pairs. Unfortunately, through all this good work, we had an unwelcome discovery – a most serious bug with Omeka 2.01. We learned that if you delete one exhibit in this version of Omeka, the content of the remaining exhibits will be deleted. Recently added exhibits were gone – hours of work effort were lost. The Project Management team had planned to meet on January 21 to draft the agenda for our next group meeting, map out our schedule for the spring semester, and to define the close of Phase One. We added the Omeka issue for further discussion. Here is what we discussed and decided. Launch date: We agreed to extend our launch date to June 9. All exhibits will be completed by June 2 allowing time for editorial review. Omeka: The Development Team is scheduled to meet on January 27 and will work to complete an upgrade to Omeka 2.02. We have requested a freeze on all activities in Omeka until the upgrade is completed. This unfortunate discovery about Omeka has taught us a few things. There is useful information to be found online through forums, discussion boards, etc. – Nick was able to pinpoint the mysterious disappearance of our exhibits by searching online. We are all reminded that backup is essential. The Development Team will routinely begin backing up our content every two weeks. Phase One: Our project launch scheduled for June 9 will bring Phase One to a close. We will continue to meet every two weeks until launch alternating between active workshops and presentations and updates. We think the workshops will provide great opportunity for collaborative learning and the necessary time for all of us to work on our exhibits. Phase Two: Phase Two will begin in the fall. We will continue our regular meetings and move on to new learning objectives. ",

    "content": " Tuesday's session was primarily about how to deal with a specific issue in our developing librarian blog.  We decided that we would like to share our 'four things' among ourselves (and with anyone else who is interested), but we didn't want to overwhelm the blog with repetitive content. Bob and John and Alex discussed the steps they followed to identify and implement category to page functionality. Things I learned: 1. Category to Page. The existence of this feature was an eye opener. I could think of so many possible uses for this on CLIO News, which we are using for CLIO support.  Right now we use pages for our search tips, and the main blog for general announcements. Category to page would allow us to add content to pages, and still have it go out to RSS subscribers. 2. How to add pages, menus, and sub-menus, and re-arrange the menus.  This is pretty basic, but will also be very useful for the CLIO and possibly Butler blogs. 3. It was great to see how Alex edited the retina child page to create the special layout on 'four things' page. I'm excited to try PHP. It is wonderful to have the freedom to experiment with the Developing Librarian page.  Our library blogs are administered centrally, so I don't know how much freedom there is to experiment with plug ins and other features, but now that I've seen some of the possibilities, I can at least think about how to request additional functionality, if needed. 4. PHP was originally an acronym for 'Personal Home Page.'  Now (according to wikipedia)  it is called 'PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor' which is a recursive acronym.

    "collection": "wposts",
    "content": " For the initial launch date of our Morningside project site, December 2014, we are all expected to have completed three exhibits, and to have provided access to at least twenty items, of which many should be in direct support of our exhibits. An exhibit, in a project such as ours, is a Web page that puts forward a coherent narrative or exposition, which is enhanced by the inclusion of items (documents, images, or other media). We talked a bit about exhibits at our group meeting yesterday. So I thought it might be useful, both to our group and to our larger audience ('those wonderful people out there in the dark,' as Norma Desmond would say), if I shared my current ideas for three exhibits regarding my building--the Cathedral Church of St John the Divine--and the process by which I arrived at them. First, I read the segment on the cathedral in Andrew Dolkart''s book Morningside Heights. Through this, I identified six persons of interest: the first three bishops involved in the proposal for and building of the cathedral (spanning the period 1872 to 1946) and three architects (the team of two who won the design competition and the one who was hired to replace them). Next, I looked up all six in American National Biography Online. Three had entries there; and each entry ended with a valuable bibliography listing key relevant archives and published works. For persons who did not have entries in ANB, I searched for relevant archives in ArchiveGrid and Columbia''s Archival Portal. This grounded me in a sense of which persons and events would be open to being explored in depth using unpublished documents. Finally, I took a tour of the church itself, led by a historically informed guide; and I asked questions along the way. Here are my current basic ideas for three exhibits: Exhibit One: The Need for a Cathedral How was the need for an Episcopal cathedral in New York City presented in early discussions and fund-raising efforts? I will start the story in 1872 when the proposal for establishing a cathedral for the diocese of New York was approved at an Episcopal Convention. I will end in 1946 with the retirement of Bishop William Manning--the last bishop to oversee ambitious expansions of the cathedral's functional space. Relevant local archives: - The Rt. Rev. Horatio Potter, 1821-1915, Papers, Trinity Church - Bishop Henry Codman Potter, 1835-1908, Papers, St. Mark's Library, General Theological Seminary - Bishop William T. Manning, 1866-1949, archives of the Episcopal Diocese of New York Exhibit Two: Competing Visions In order to select the architects for the new cathedral, the trustees held a design competition from 1888-1892 (Dolkart, 41-50). Although the architectural team of George Lewis Heins and Christopher Grant La Farge won this competition, it might accurately be said that competing visions for how the cathedral should be designed were at play as long as the cathedral was being built. After the death of Heins, the trustees replaced La Farge with architect Ralph Adams Cram (in 1911). This choice was an interesting one, considering that Cram, in his book Church Building (1901), had argued for the superiority of the English Gothic style for cathedrals, whereas the work completed so far by Heins and La Farge was primarily Romanesque. Cram had even written dismissively of the then recent design competition: 'When the competition for the New York cathedral was held, we saw at once how blind were the gropings, both of the Church and of the architects. Practically, none of the designs submitted showed the least appreciation of the cathedral idea.... It was the chance of a century, and none came forward to seize upon it to the glory of the Church and to his own immortality.' (195-196). The final illustration in Cram's chapter titled 'The Cathedral' is of Heins and La Farge's design. It bears the caption 'NEW YORK CATHEDRAL (ACCEPTED DESIGN)' (214). Cram nowhere mentions the names of the architects nor does he comment explicitly on their design. (They would, however, seem to be implicated in Cram's sweeping 'none came forward....') It can hardly be surprising, therefore, that Cram had very limited regard for continuity in design principles as he expanded the cathedral that Heins and La Farge had begun. Relevant local archives: Avery Drawings & Archives holds collections related to Heins & La Farge, and St. John the Divine. Exhibit Three: Spaces for Worship In 1899 'the first services [were] held in a chapel of the crypt.' Services moved upstairs in 1911 when the Chapel of St. Columba was consecrated, and were first held in the nave in 1939. The Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, New York (Bloomfield, CT: Finlay Printing, 2008), 55-56, 58. Throughout most of the period that I will cover, people's experience of the cathedral was centered on spaces other than the nave (which is the space that most of us today probably think of when we think of this cathedral). I hope that this exhibit will have a defamiliarizing effect--prompting people to reconsider the cathedral as an entity built over time, whose center of gravity repeatedly shifted. Relevant local archives: To be determined. Overall, my hope is to create exhibits that provide strong angles of light on three aspects of the cathedral's history. Exhibits two and three will have strong visual interest. Exhibit one is more conceptual, but I will aim to enhance with images of relevant documents such as fund-raising appeals. ",

    "content": " In our Developing Librarian Meeting today we moved forward in various ways. The Project Management team (Nancy and John) presented to the group a new central Google-shared space containing a folder for each team, foundational project documents, and our project timeline. Teams were invited to deposit in their folders any documents that they wished to share with the group as a whole. The Development Team reported that they were ahead of projected deadline for creating and sharing amongst themselves a GitHub repository. Meredith and Alex explained more to the group about the importance of GitHub. It allows the Development Team to stay synchronized with one another in making design changes, sharing data, and posting content. So far there is a Master branch and a Design branch. There can be any number of branches. An important principle in GitHub is that any branch other than the Master branch might get broken but the integrity of accomplished work will be preserved as long as the Master branch remains intact. The Development Team is using GitHub to work on the scaffolding or platform for our Morningside project site. We have so far been individually contributing various items with various content fields concerning buildings or places in Morningside Heights. The platform designed in GitHub will determine how users interact with those items, how they are presented, etc. Individuals were invited to continue adding items as appropriate to our old bare-bones project site. All of these will finally be absorbed into the platform currently under design. The Design Team has two logos under consideration. These two, with variants, will be presented to the group as a whole by late May. It was decided that any instruction being provided to any team should be announced in advance to the group as a whole, so that anyone who wished to could participate. For example, Alex was scheduled to meet with the Design Team after this morning's meeting in order to instruct them in how to use the program Illustrator for design of logos. Other group members decided to join in this instructional session in order to learn Illustrator basics. ",

    "content": " The main focus of today's meeting was on exhibits. __1. What is an exhibit?__ And what do I need to do to create one? An exhibit is an essay or narrative illustrated by online items that support or enrich what is being said. There is no prescribed length. It should be as long as it needs to be to tell the story you want to tell. We should assume that our audience has no knowledge of the topic of our exhibit. Meredith showed the group how exhibits and specific exhibit pages can be created using straightforward options at our Omeka site. For each page in your exhibit you can choose from a variety of layout choices. The Design Team will be communicating with the Development Team regarding basic visual appearance options such as color and font. While those appearance options will alter the appearance of our exhibits, they will not alter our content or layout choices. Each individual should begin, as soon as she or he is ready, to create exhibits and exhibit pages, choose layouts, and add content. __2. Timeline and requirements__ The team decided to extend the initial launch deadline for the public site to January 21, thus taking advantage of the lull time of Winter break to get work completed. Each exhibit should have a minimum of eight items integrated into it. People are free to add more items if they wish--either to their exhibits or to our public site in general, where all items will be browsable as items. __3. Example of an exhibit__ John discussed with the group an exhibit he had created for his chosen Morningside location--Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine. He chose to focus on the competing visions of the architects who worked on the cathedral. Due to time constraints he limited archival research to Avery Drawings. For this building, he felt that there was enough non-archival material available to tell the story he wanted to tell. One key resource of interest for most of our locations is the database 'American Periodicals (1740-1940).' This includes a good selection of architectural periodicals for 19th and 20th centuries. ",

These will be used for search capability and the documentation of items in our collections. We decided to use these elements for now, with the caveat that we can revisit and adjust these as questions arise while we are developing our projects. We’ve renamed “Date” to “Date Created.” There was some question of how this will affect items where the date created may differ from the publication date. As we proceed with the project we may revisit this decision. We also decided to create a custom-defined field named “Decade” for search functionality. Our 10 Dublin Core fields are: Title; Subject; Description; Creator; Source; Publisher; Date Created;  Rights; Type; Decade.

    "content": " New York Public Library's Map Warper. New York Public Library’s Map Warper tool helps you visualize how the landscape of a particular place has changed over time. I signed up for Map Warper specifically to complete an assignment in Professor Debbie Rabina’s Information Services & Resources spring 2013 course at Pratt Institute. What I gleaned from Professor Rabina’s assignment was that professionals in a service model environment should become more familiar with geographic information systems (and other tools) as they are being used more widely by researchers at all levels. The basic function of Map Warper is to digitally align - or rectify - historical maps from their collection to match contemporary maps. In my opinion, Map Warper does so much more. Through this tool, NYPL is opening their amazing map collection (from all over the world) to the public and encourages visitors to interact with their collection to see what can be learned through geospatial information studies. What is special about Map Warper, compared to other GIS tools I’ve dabbled with, is that it allows you to crop or mask the historic maps. Masking allows you to crop a historic map to the exact area you’re interested in, if not the entire area of the map. The example NYPL uses in their video tutorial on the homepage is Central Park. This seemingly small detail became quite a luxury for me while working with this tool. Similar tools I’ve found either don’t allow masking or it is much more difficult to figure out how to mask. Example of masked and rectified map. [Central Park, 1860.] New York Public Library's Map Warper. One particular aspect I wrote about in my review for this tool in my assignment for Professor Rabina’s class was on the topic of street name changes. Once you’ve rectified a map, you can adjust the transparency of the historic map and begin to see the differences more clearly. Similar to New York City, my home city of Baltimore, Maryland underwent street name changes around the early 1900s. This type of information is critical for some researchers because previous street names appear in city directories and archival materials from the time before the names changed. Example of street name changes. [Queens, Part of Ward Four, 1907, updated 1912.] NYPL's Map Warper. I'm particularly interested in using maps in this way for the Morningside Heights project considering my topic is the history of the natural and built environment of the neighborhood, and I know for certain that the rest of the team is interested as well. Maps can tie all of our topics together in a way that provides a unique visualization for visitors. This also makes me excited for Information Visualization, one of my courses for the fall semester.

Rolling back may be necessitated if a change made to the functionality of a site, for example, the addition of a plug-in, has unforeseen negative consequences. * Think of your Web site as having three operational stages: development, test, and production. Changes to the functionality of the site (for example, the addition of plug-ins or changes to PHP code) need to be made at the development level. Then they should be tested by the group.

    "content": " I thought I knew the four things I had learned from today's session. They are listed below. But then, when I read Barbara's post, 'Revisiting Requirements Guidelines,' I realized that we really were returning in today's session to crucial principles from some of our earliest meetings.  In one of those meetings, Alex had asked us to think carefully about what our requirements were for the site and had warned us of the danger of having requirements that were too diffuse or too great in number. This idea was revisited today when we were asked to think of digital history projects as being situated on a spectrum reflecting varying degrees of formality, exactitude, and time-commitment. Four things learned today: 1. We should picture digital history projects as existing on a spectrum. At the formal end of the spectrum are projects that expand the realm of FEDORA resources. At the less formal end of the spectrum is what we are doing: compiling exhibits and narratives. An example of a project on the FEDORA end of the spectrum is the Avery real-estate brochures project: it is highly systematic, employs high resolution images, makes a coherent special collection public, and serves as a full-fledged scholarly resource. Those are all virtues; but they are out of scope for us. Our Morningside Project site allows a high level of individual freedom in the creation of exhibits. Individual project curators can decide on the types of stories they wish to tell. We will not be creating high resolution images that scholars can use as a substitute for the real artifacts. Although our site will implement overarching features that contribute to site coherence and functionality, these will not require the level of hyper-meticulous, time-consuming, and systematic pre-planning characteristic of a more formal site. 2. Our project site is the flip side of our process site. Each enhances the value of the other. 3. Exhibits are where the story is told. Collections are where we store the resources to be used in exhibits. An exhibit can draw its items from any number of our Morningside collections or it can focus on items from a single collection. 4. Peer programming is a technique whereby one individual directs another step-by-step how to enter data, etc. It is a useful technique for teaching, learning, and programming. ",

    "content": " Now that our Developing Librarian group has been formed into teams (see message immediately below), we have turned our attention to the areas of project planning and management. On March 4, our meeting was devoted to a project management workshop with Mitch Brodsky from the New York Philharmonic. Two important takeaways were as follows: 1. agree upon the minimal content and functionality required for the initial launch of your project and 2. an excel spreadsheet can serve as an easy-to-use but high-performance project-management tool Both of these concepts became key aspects of our project management planning. Last Friday, the Project Management team, Nancy Friedland and myself, met with Alex Gil (who will be floating advisor to all teams) to develop our Project Management schema for the Morningside Heights Web Site.  The result of our meeting was a spreadsheet in Google Docs listing tasks for each team, each task followed by a row of deadline date options. The tasks listed were those that would need to be completed in order for our site to launch on its planned initial launch date of December 2014. The spreadsheet also specifies that, parallel with the overarching  tasks assigned to the teams, each individual needs to be completing research, gathering items, and planning exhibits for his/her specific chosen building. At today's meeting, the Project Management spreadsheet was shared with the group. An open discussion was held about the tasks proposed for each team and each team was allowed to determine its own time frame for the completion of each task. The discussion was extremely helpful insofar as it enabled us to achieve some clarity on how tasks are interrelated and where tasks involve one team working with the assistance of another. For example, the design team will be making layout choices, regarding aspects such as logo, header, and footer; but the development team is responsible for implementing those layout choices. The research group is responsible for establishing metadata standards; but the individuals working on specific buildings should also keep the research group updated with a list of buildings, persons, and entities that will be made reference to in their branch of the project. Choices and decisions made by teams regarding the various aspects of the site will be submitted to the group as a whole for feedback. It was agreed that as one aspect of task completion each team would be responsible to post to this public blog about some aspect[s] of the process of completing the task. All in all, today's meeting was very productive and energizing for the group as a whole. ",

Initially, the hospital occupied five buildings with continued expansion through the 1950s. In the early 1950s, St. Luke's and Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons established an affiliation. The first open-heart surgery in New York City was conducted at St. Luke's in 1955. St. Luke's Hospital neighbors Columbia University's Morningside campus and sits to the north of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine. St. Luke's merged with Roosevelt Hospital in 1979.

    "content": " Several years ago, when I was a new librarian, the Humanities and History Division went on a field trip to the 42nd Street branch of the New York Public Library.  We were shown around and given in-depth tours of the Milstein Division of US History, Local History and Genealogy, as well as the Map Division.  Matt Knutzen, the Map Librarian, had pulled out a wealth of historical maps for us, including some of Morningside Heights before Columbia's arrival.  There was one map that indicated property ownership, and it was then that I noticed the Lion Brewery, just east southeast of where the university now stands. I remember wondering which came first: the Lion Brewery, or the Columbia Lions?  It was a question that niggled at the back of my mind all these years, without my ever doing a thing about investigating it--but when it came time to choose a building to research, the brewery was the first thing that occurred to me. The Lion Brewery was a massive operation, spanning two uptown and one crosstown block.  In a December 1891 article in The Evening World, describing the $82.45 that brewery employees raised for the newspaper's Christmas-tree fund, the address is given merely as 109th Street and 9th Avenue (now Columbus).  The brewery proprietor at the time was a Mr Simon E Bernheimer, of Bernheimer & Schmid, but by July 1903, The Evening World was reporting that Mrs Josephine Schmid was buying out her partners, the Bernheimer brothers, to become the sole proprietor of the brewery, then valued at $5,000,000 and producing half a million barrels of beer a year.  Mrs Schmid owned fifty saloons, and was known as the 'Brewery Queen;' the Lion Brewery was then the second largest brewery in the east. The brewery was adjoined by Lion Brewery Park, which spread from 107th to 108th Streets along Columbus Avenue (more details on the Park to come, I hope).  An 1859 article in The New York Times, about a large fire at the brewery, claims it was built two years earlier. The fire was not the brewery's only brush with drama.  In 1865, a murder occurred in the Lion Brewery Park, during a picnic held by the Manhattanville Church of the Annuciation. In 1908, Mrs Schmid's daughter filed suit against her mother for her share of the profits as set out in the late Mr Schmid's will.  In November 1921, an explosion in an 'ammonia refrigerating pipe' on the second floor of the brewery blew out every window on the floor as well as some in neighboring buildings.

    "content": " For the past few weeks, I've been viewing archival materials at Columbia's Rare Book & Manuscript Library (RBML). Two collections have played a significant role in my research: the Buildings & Grounds Collection (1755-2012) and the Historical Photographs Collection (1855-2012). I found maps, letters, and photographs that all pertain to my research topic. I've been rethinking the way I collect digital resources during this project. As a student, I had a good understanding of my research strengths and weaknesses. The system I would devise for this project had to allow me to be mobile considering I would have to visit different libraries as well as keep all of my sources in one simple place. For precisely these reasons, I chose to create a form in Google Drive that would aggregate all my source information to a spreadsheet. The form was created to record digital and analog resources that I discover during my preliminary search and would easily allow me to get back to those resources for further investigation. The form took a bit of time to create and was based on the following questions: - What am I looking for? - What am I using to look for it? (Platform of source) - How did I get here? (Search terms) - What did I find? (Title of material, format, etc.) - How did I retain the information? (File names, bookmarks, etc.) - What is the copyright information for what I’ve found? - How does this fit into my thesis? The form is great for text but does not work for images (reference photographs) of primary sources. For this part of my research, I have turned to Evernote. With Evernote, you can write simple text notes, add photographs to notes, record audio, and more. Each note can be easily organized within a notebook and notebooks can be organized within 'stacks.' Evernote and the Google form relate in a parent/child relationship. The basic collection information is recorded via the Google form (with a note about whether or not the collection was actually viewed) and Evernote is used to capture individual items within that collection. I struggled with how to organize reference photographs of documents I need to evaluate for future possible digitization. In the past I've used the camera on my phone, which leads to wasted time, chaos, and frustration because each of those snaps would have to be corralled somehow, not to mention the fact that all of my work related snaps would be mixed with photographs from my personal life. Before heading over to RBML, I decided to take reference photos using my iPad. One of the best aspects of Evernote is that you can install it on your computer, use it as a web application, and download it on your mobile device.  There are lots of applications that can sync to your Evernote account to make it more efficient based on your needs. I'm curious to hear how others use Evernote so that I enhance my own experience. I have a feeling I haven't discovered all it has to offer quite yet. Notes within my Morningside RBML notebook. Each note contains information about where the image came from. ",

    "content": " In today's session I and Bob Scott reported to the group on our experience working with Alex Gil to implement a site enhancement. The site enhancement was the introduction of a distinct page titled 'Four Things' to which any posting assigned the 'four-things' category (as its sole category) would go directly--bypassing the main blog posting page. We had already agreed that the four things exercise--in which each of us states the four things that he or she learned from each session--was a crucial part of our learning process. We also recognized, however, that there would be a certain amount of overlap or redundancy between these postings. Thus they would not be ideal for the main blog page that represents us to our general readership. Readers who are interested in the process aspects of our learning process, however, will value the newly implemented Four Things page. Four Things I learned from today's session (08-20-13): - If there is room for debate about how something should be done in a Wordpress environment, the best approach is for one or more persons to build a prototype. That way the group can see what is being proposed. - Being obliged to teach something to others really forces you to learn it yourself. For example: in order to report to the group on what Alex, Bob, and I did together to implement the Four Things page, I had to think very carefully, meet with Bob and Alex, and repeat the original steps. Hence most of my internalization of what we did took place not while we were doing it but afterwards when we were thinking about how we would explain it to the group. - One simple approach to finding out how to accomplish something in Wordpress is simply to do a Google search beginning with word 'wordpress.' For example: wordpress posts skip main page You will need to evaluate the results you retrieve. Good answers can be found in the Wordpress Codex (the official user manual) or in forums. But you may find solutions that are far more complex than what you feel comfortable attempting. There are often a number of different ways to accomplish something in Wordpress. You typically want to go for the simplest. Don't forget to consult with others in the group as needed. - Familiarize yourself as much as possible with the organization and functions of the Wordpress administrative backend to our site--what is under Appearance, Settings, etc., and how it all works. You might be thinking of something as a problem for which you need to search for solutions, when it might simply be a function already available in the Wordpress administrative end of our site. Even if it is not already available, knowing what is available helps you to understand better the nature of proposed solutions when you do start looking for them. ",

The specifications decided on by the Design Team, regarding logos, homepage design, etc., are being turned over to the Development Team for further work. For a full report on the Design Team's progress, see Karen's August 15 posting 'Design Team Update..' 3. Redistributing Project Responsibilities One of our colleagues, Mary Cargill, will be retiring in October. She was one of the originators of the Morningside history project idea, and her expertise has enriched the historical awareness of the group from the beginning. She is a member of the Research and Editorial Team and had been researching the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum as her individual project component. We have agreed on the following adjustments in order to keep the project on track. a. 'Fact checking' will be removed from the responsibilities assigned to the Research and Editorial Team in our project agenda and time line. 'Metadata standards' will be retained as the team's key responsibility. Beginning in October, this team will simply be the Editorial Team. Each librarian creating exhibits will be responsible for maintaining and verifying the historical accuracy of his or her own exhibits. Since only one person is now left on the Editorial Team, we will need to be open to reassessing this workflow and providing further assistance as needed. b. The last research task of the Research and Editorial team before it shifts into Editorial mode will be a bibliography of selected key general sources relevant to the history of Morningside Heights. The deadline for this bibliography is September 30, 2014. c. Karen Green, who had earlier been focusing on the Lion Brewery, agreed to focus her exhibits on the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum instead. 4. Open labs and instructional sessions The next two regularly scheduled meetings of the Developing Librarian group will be instructional sessions: 8/26 will be a Zotero session led by Bob Scott; 9/9 will be a session on uploading items to the project site, led by Alex Gil. Two open labs, at which people can work on whatever aspect of the project they wish, will be held during the week of 8/18-8/22. ",

Both designs demonstrated considerable ingenuity. One key consideration in logo selection was scalability. Would the key idea of logo remain clear in small, medium, and larger versions? The Development Team reported on its progress. In a phase of initial enthusiasm, more than one team member would work on the same file in GitHub. They discovered, however, that this was not the best approach. Files in GitHub are not like documents in Google Docs, which can easily accommodate collaborative contributions. Multiple contributions to the same file from different users in GitHub actually creates conflicts. Older versions are not overwritten, but users are alerted to differences. The team decided it will take a more coordinated approach to files in GitHub, assigning responsibilities for specific files to specific individuals. In the open forum phase of meeting, it was suggested that the group revisit the project time line. Corrections and clarifications were made there. A question arose around individual research for our Morningside History project. How do you determine the scope of your research and exhibits? The amount of potential information available regarding any given location, building, or individual can be daunting. All agreed to devote a significant portion of our next group meeting to discussing such questions. Barbara proposed as an assignment for each of us the simple topic definition exercise that some of us use for students of the University Writing Program: I am researching __________________________ because I want to find out ___________________________ in order for my reader to understand ________________________________ .

Sarah will fully focus on Development Team. Karen was away -- we will consult with her on new post shortly. Due to scheduling conflicts, we discussed a new role for Nick. He will assist with staying on top of discussion regarding Omeka. __Presentation of Design__ Alex presented the work of the Design Team. The team has been hard at work creating our “front page.” See previous post that outlines the process. Overall, the group was delighted with the map, logo, and title. We did not agree on the color palette. Some felt the colors too strong (mix of red and yellow). There was also concern about changing the color of the map. John noted that we are using a historical map for a history research project and we should stay true to the original color palette. There was group consensus to ask Design Team to come back with a subtler color palette. __Development Team__ Because of the inclement weather and the rare closing of the university, Development Team had to postpone the migration to the newer version of Omeka. The migration was completed on February 9. We have received the go ahead to begin working on the site. We are still working out backup procedures so best advice – everyone should keep backups of the text for exhibit pages in Microsoft Word or Google Drive. __Schedule for Duration of Phase One__ We will continue to meet every two weeks alternating between presentation/updates and a workshop model to provide time for all members of the group to work on their exhibits. We believe that providing time to workshop together will encourage collaborative learning. ",

    "content": " When this site went live,  we all agreed that we would post regularly.  A schedule was proposed and circulated, and we all signed up to post once every five weeks.  With enthusiasm, I signed up to post in October.   The topics were left open, and now that the semester is in full swing, whenever I have a free moment I've been thinking about stemming  in CLIO, Columbia's new Blacklight discovery interface, specifically stemming in the catalog. Stemming, or lemmatisation is a feature used in many SOLR databases. It functions by reducing a word to its 'stem' and then adding all possible suffixes. So a search for Methodism retrieved methodist(s) and methodism(s) but it also retrieved every record containing the terms method, methods, methodical, etc.  It also affected results because in some cases the abbreviated stem was stored in the indexes, so a search for 'methodis*' would not retrieve methodist or methodism because the term had been stored as 'method'. This also affects facets and the ability to sort results. Although the default relevance ranking displays matching terms at the top of the results list, facets are based on the full results set, and re-sorting by date has confused researchers who no longer see their terms in the results. This stemmed search for orientalism retrieves more than 52,000 records: If we turn off stemming, the facets will be more relevant, terms will be stored in their full, unstemmed version so use of wildcards will retrieve full results, but inexperienced users who don't know to use asterisks and other wildcard symbols will not find all possible results. I serve on the planning committee for the CLIO Blacklight interface and we decided to survey our Columbia University Libraries/Information Services colleagues.   Based on our own discussion and feedback from librarians, faculty, and others who expressed dismay at retrieving 'irrelevant results,' we have decided to disable stemming in the catalog. The new, unstemmed search retrieves 2% of the results retrieved in the stemmed orientalism search.  Facets now relate specifically to the search term, and sorting  is useful. However, searchers will need to remember to use the wildcard to get all possible endings for their searches: orientalis* will retrieve orientalist(s) orientalism(s) etc. We made a decision that seemed to make sense based on feedback and search logs, but we will continue monitor the database and  searching.   It may be that other stemmers will become available that will give more accurate and nuanced results.   It is great to be developing our own interface, where we have the ability to make changes based on our environment, but it is also scary to have the freedom to make these decisions.

The designer can encode multiple sets of instructions based on different screen sizes. These instructions determine how the design will configure itself for each screen size. 2. Overlapping elements are a common feature in graphic and typographical design in a print environment. True overlap is not well suited for Web design because Web design is based on entities with distinct boundaries. Web designs that achieve the appearance of overlap are unstable--that is, the composition will change in unpredictable ways on different browsers or with different screen sizes. 3. Different Web browsers have different protocols for interpreting page encoding. Thus the same page can look different on different browsers and functionality may vary as well. 4. Three key elements of design are: layout, typography, and color. ",

    "content": " Two years ago we announced a professional development program in the Columbia University Libraries for the Humanities & History Division. In our first iteration of the Developing Librarian project or, as we refer to it on social media, the #devlib project, our goal was to build a common project using an adaptation of the Praxis model for professional librarians. Today, the Developing Librarian team is proud to announce the launch of our site, Morningside Heights Digital History, or MHDH. After an initial round of 'introductions' to the technologies and skills needed to design our site, we divided into teams: design, editorial, management and development. For a more detailed breakdown of our different roles, please visit our credits page. The project was built on the Omeka platform, using the Neatline plugin for the interactive map and an interactive tour of the Butler Library Mural, and the Exhibit Builder for our different exhibits. We chose the Berlin theme, and modified it to suit our needs. The research was done individually, but we shared bibliographic and archival resources. We documented the process throughout on our Developing Librarian blog, where you are now. When we set out to do this as a team, we wanted to accomplish much: to expand our ability to support and consult in digital humanities, to hone our research skills, to bridge the gap between IT and subject librarianship, and to bond as a team by sharing a common project. We feel we have accomplished all of these and more. In particular, we find all aspects of our work as a team have benefited from developing a project together. Learning to build consensus around difficult issues will have a lasting effect on all we do in the libraries and on campus. We have many people to thank for this project: our technology team and library administrators in the Columbia University Libraries, who have seen the importance of flexibility in the technical infrastructure for our training efforts. We are also appreciative of all the conversations and feedback from colleagues at many universities, including the University of Indiana, University of Minnesota, University of Virginia, University of Florida, New York University, and Duke University. Following this first phase of our project, we will continue our professional development through a series of targeted training sessions for and by our team and others at Columbia University Libraries. We will continue to share what we learn on our blog. We have grown as individuals and as a team during the past three years of this project. In the next phase, we will expand this model to enhance our own research (for example, one team member will be using digital tools to assess variant versions of an unpublished play by Tennessee Williams), following a model pioneered by Trevor Munoz and MITH in their Digital Humanities Incubator for libraries. We will also be partnering with faculty to create and co-teach digital labs attached to traditional humanities courses, to improve our digital pedagogical skills. We have always emphasized process over product in this training, but we are excited to share our web exhibit and this model for future professional development at Columbia and elsewhere. __Humanities & History team, Columbia University__ ",

Creative Commons License for our Morningside History project site Near the start of our process, we discussed Creative Commons license options and settled on a CC-BY 3.0 US License. This is featured on the front page of our Developing Librarian process / blog site, which states in the bottom margin 'This work is licensed under a CC-BY 3.0 US License.' In our meeting today we discussed licensing and terms of use issues for our Morningside Heights Digital History project site. Unlike our process / blog site, our project site contains a substantial variety of different types of the_content: for example, original exhibit text written by team authors, images used with permission of institutions, etc. Various things emerged clearly in the discussion: - We need two kinds of license, or terms of use statements--one covering our original content and one covering images or documents that we are using with permission or through public domain. We have authority to determine reuse conditions under a CC license for our original content. For images or documents we did not create, however, we need an appropriate statement in which responsibility for seeking reuse permissions, where needed, is left with the user. - The default when no CC license statement is included is that originally authored materials are covered under ordinary copyright. We decided, however, that we should select and apply a specific CC license to the original content on our project site. The CC licenses [http://creativecommons.org/licenses/](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/) all share in common attribution, or crediting of author, as a basic element. There were varying opinions about whether or not we should select a CC license that adds ND (no derivatives) and/or NC (no commercial use) onto the basic CC BY license. In the course of our discussion, we found it very helpful to consider [Omeka showcase](https://omeka.org/showcase/) which provides links to a variety of Omeka sites and their statements of terms of use conditions. ___Action Item:___ Bob Scott and John Tofanelli will draft and send to the group for approval a terms of use statement for the project site. Once the group has approved that statement, Bob and John will submit it to Rina Panatalony, Director of our Copyright Advisory Office for review. 2. Libraries Information Technology Office (LITO) guidelines Our Morningside History project site will be moving to a Columbia University Libraries (CUL) server before it launches publicly this June. We therefore need to bring it into conformity with standards applicable to all sites housed on CUL servers. We looked at Columbia Univerity Libraries' 'Visual Identity & Website Guidelines,' which is the key document. Alex will bring our site into conformity with these guidelines in terms of incorporating Columbia banner, etc. ",

    "content": " In his Introduction to The Cathedral Church of St John the Divine (1916), the Very Rev. William Mercer Grosvenor, then Dean of the Cathedral, wrote:  “It is evident that we are at the very beginning of what we believe to be a great future for this Cathedral. We are trying to make it the centre of a far-reaching spiritual influence, and at the same time to go forward toward the completion of the building itself.”  It is this dynamic interplay between the will to exert spiritual influence at every stage of the building’s development and the more tangible effort to move the building toward completion that fascinates me in the early history of the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. At the time of Grosvenor’s writing, the nave of the cathedral was still unbuilt. Yet sermons preached at the Cathedral had already been published, putting it on the map as a center of spiritual influence: for example, “The Talisman of Unity: A Sermon in Behalf of Church Consolidation Preached in the Crypt of the Cathedral of St. John the Divine Sunday January the Twenty Second 1899” by William Reed Huntington. The Cathedral’s crypt accommodated “a congregation of 500 persons” and had only been opened for use on January 8, 1899 (Cathedral Church, p. 22), two weeks prior to Huntington’s sermon. Huntington was well known as an ecumenical thinker, and had been a trustee of the Cathedral since 1887. To have a sermon worthy of publication preached in the crypt so soon after its opening served a double purpose such as Dean Grosvenor articulates: it helped to make the nascent Cathedral “the centre of a far-reaching spiritual influence” while it also raised public awareness that new milestones were being reached in the growth of the Cathedral toward completion. The good will of the public tends to play an important role in the completion of religious buildings. Subscriptions and donations are mentioned throughout Cathedral Church as playing a key role in the financing of the building. Thus Dean Grosvenor, with his dual emphasis on spiritual impact and physical building, shows a genuine practical understanding of what is needed to get a religious building built. The public needs to be made aware that the building, however incomplete it may be, is an effective centre of spiritual influence; but they also need to be made aware that the building is moving effectively towards physical completion and thus growing in functionality.

    "link": "/hello-world-getting-into-coding/",
    "collection": "wposts",
    "content": " We've reached the point in our project where the group is beginning to get into basics of coding. I find this phase of the project very engaging. I think all of us have at some point thought 'I could make that (application/database/widget/user experience) better,' and digging into code opens the door to just how that might be done... even if we are talking about baby steps here. There has been a lot of interesting discussion in the past couple years about the perceived merits of 'everyone learning to code' (for example, this piece from Aug 2013 on Slate.com presents a skeptical view of this notion; another interesting recent discussion is here, on the Communications of the ACM website). A little knowledge can be a dangerous thing. In our case, I think that as a group we're reasonably (and realistically) focused on gaining a basic literacy in the language(s) we're most likely to encounter, without expecting to become expert coders - but learning enough to implement our History of Morningside Heights project. I've had some early skirmishes with coding: in the late 1980s I did some coding in the early audio programming language Csound: I would type text files of instructions to create sound, and then send them to a PDP-11 computer in the basement of MIT's Experimental Media Lab: After a few minutes, sound (often a dreadful shock) would come back, and it would be back to the drawing board, to refine the code in the instrument definitions and score file. The reason I mention this ancient ritual is that I am relieved to see that the proposition of learning and writing basic code has become easier, much easier, over time, and there are now many options for languages where significant parts of the repetitive 'grunt work' and housekeeping routines have been taken care of for programmers. Things have gotten more modular. In addition, many free and user-friendly beginning coding sites and resources have sprung up, such as Codecademy. Alex, our fearless instructor on matters digital, has also recommended sites like 'Learn Python the Hard Way' (but, the term 'The Hard Way,' I admit, gives me pause!) One of the questions that confronts me, and probably others of us dipping our toes into coding, is 'which of the many languages could/would/should I learn?' I'm not sure what that the answer is, but suspect it might run something like this - learn a basic familiarity with those languages that we might commonly encounter in our partnering with faculty and technologists on digital projects, and then, go more in-depth with a language (or languages) with which we ourselves might want to learn to build things (yes, we can!). With suites of languages and modular tools focused on building web applications, the ever-increasing availability of APIs and open data sets, it begins to seem plausible that one can build something, without being a dedicated computer science expert. For example, I was motivated and impressed by a recent project built to synchronize highlighted scanned music notation with audio playback, the Augmented Notes tool. The author, Joanna Swafford, was able in a couple of years to learn the skills to be able to do this. For me, Python seems to be a good place to start. I've begun the Codecademy tutorials, and am excited to attend a class on Python for humanists. Python makes sense for me because I had a chance to informally poll a crowd of researchers at a recent Music Information Retrieval event the Libraries hosted here on campus, and although a lot of earlier work in this area was done in Matlab, Python emerged as a strong recommendation for new work going forward. I plan to pursue this as my entree into current coding, and then branch out from there, as it intersects strongly with my desire to learn to work with Music Information Retrieval tools and techniques, and with some of my personal creative interests. So, 'Hello World,' off I go on the coding adventure. Wish me luck! ",

    "content": " 1. Location for Morningside Workshop meetings The group agreed that these will be held in our Digital Humanities Center on scheduled Tuesdays 10-11. The computers there have big screens conducive to working on exhibits. They also have the full range of software we might want to use. 2. Map color scheme for site home page Anice was the only member of Design Team in attendance at this meeting. She was asked to let the Design Team know that they should hold a meeting within the next couple of weeks. The group had decided at our last meeting, and in subsequent emails on our Developing Librarian email list, that the map featured on our site home page should follow the original color scheme of the historical map, with some modification allowed for darkening in PhotoShop to make colors and shapes stand out more sharply. This will call for a rethinking of the entire color scheme of the home page and the wire frame used for it. Design team needs to select colors from paletton.com that harmonize with the colors on the map and then to provide the color codes to the Development Team. Our current version of the map, as darkened by Anice and Bob and approved by the group, is accessible in Google Drive in the MHDH Logos folder. The Design Team should feel free to modify brightness and contrast for optimal appearance of map. 3. Update from Development Team regarding transition to latest version of Omeka This was handled by Alex and went smoothly. Alex pointed out that Omeka does not automatically transfer Omeka sites to the latest version of the software. He also advised that we should not feel any need to migrate our site to the latest version of Omeka every time a new version comes out. We migrated from the earlier version in which our site was first created to a much later version in this instance mainly because the earlier version contained a serious bug. Migration of a site to a new version of Omeka can involve risks, so any decisions about migration need to be carefully considered. 4. Chicago Manual of Style (16th edition) Anice asked the group on behalf of the editorial team what it thought of John's suggestion that the project should follow Chicago Manual of Style (16th edition) for citation style. The group agreed to this. Advantages to Chicago Manual pointed out were: it deals clearly with a very wide variety of formats; and it is a style often recommended by history journals. 5. Recap of issues that have lately surfaced on our Developing Librarian email list a. People might wish in the creation of their exhibit pages to include hyperlinks taking users to item files that have been saved in our Omeka project site, but that are not directly incorporated into the page in question. Creating a hyperlink, using the url that appears when the item in question is fullscreen in our Omeka site, will have the desired effect--for now only. Such links should be recognized as 'absolute' links: they take the user to a specific item on a specific server. Once our site has moved to a Columbia University Libraries server, all such absolute links will need to be revised. It is also possible to create 'relative' links, which are more based on the orientation of one item in relation to another. These would stay valid even after our project moves to a new server. Overall, people seemed to feel that the simplest approach would be to stick with absolute links, keep track of where they are used, and be prepared to revise them when site moves to new server. b. No substantial discussion was devoted to the following topic. So the minutes will simply relate what was decided in email. When faced with the choice of uploading a file as an item to our Omeka site as either JPG or PDF, we should choose JPG, even for text files. JPG files are considerably smaller and this decreases load time for site users. Load time is a key issue that influences user satisfaction with the usability of a site. 6. Assignment due Tuesday March 24 Each group member was asked to create an exhibit page featuring at least one item along with draft text. All were referred to examples of exhibit pages already created by group members on our Omeka project site. 7. Editorial issues We are all a bit unclear about how to fill out the fields that appear in the Dublin Core template when we upload item files to our Omeka project site. For now we are all simply following our best guess. In March and April we will be turning to the Editorial Team for substantial further guidance. ",

We presented two options for website logos that we created in Adobe Illustrator to the larger group and after a democratic vote, one was chosen. Before we got to this stage though, we first had to produce both logos in Illustrator. To help us learn the program we were fortunate to have a tutorial with one of our Columbia Libraries colleagues, Jeffrey Lancaster. Jeffrey gave us a tutorial that was perfectly geared to our skill level as well as focusing on our particular issues with each logo. He began by describing the difference between a raster image and a vector image. In the raster image each pixel is a unique color and the image is a grid when looked at up close. The vector image is flat color with points connected by lines. Each image scales differently. The raster image (used in Adobe Photoshop) scales by adding new pixels with new color attributes. The vector image (used in Adobe Illustrator) scales by changing the space between points so the image stays sharp. He also showed us how to manipulate type fonts and spacing. Jeffrey described the various file types for exporting the image and recommended we use .png, portable network graphic, since it preserves transparency. Our team will be meeting next week to develop headers and footers for the website and to make some color adjustments to our new logo. ",

Elizabeth Davis will be our sole continuing member on the Editorial Team. Fortunately, she has prior editorial experience with W W Norton and a keen eye for the pragmatics of editing. We arrived at various agreements regarding metadata for items on our project site: - Persons posting items should do their best to assign each item an appropriate item type and to fill out whichever metadata fields are feasible. - Elizabeth will review our work, being on the lookout for outliers, and will communicate with contributors as needed. - In order to enhance our developing consensus on employment of metadata, we should all consult the shared spreadsheet 'Objects and metadata model.'' In that spreadsheet, one of our catalogers, Melanie Wacker, listed several examples of items that might be represented on our project site and filled out the basic Dublin Core fields for each (title, description, source, creator, etc.). - We should agree upon and employ a basic list of subject tags for use in this pre-launch phase of the project. - We have a library intern in Spring 2015 who will be working on enhancing access to our project site. She can look more closely into questions of subject tagging and recommend additions and/or revisions to our group. ",

    "collection": "wposts",
    "content": " I envision the goals of our project in the following way: Computers and the internet are rapidly changing the face of scholarship, a process perhaps most dramatically illustrated in the humanities, which has been historically less reliant than other fields on technology, but is equally present in all fields of scholarly endeavor.  Researchers today are able to assemble and work with unprecedentedly large collections of material in all media and formats to study, annotate, and analyze, and to communicate the results of their work to others, all at unprecedentedly high rates of speed.  Taking advantage of this potential represents an enormously exciting opportunity and, as more and more scholars do so, a necessity for all researchers in all fields.  For the humanities, a field where individual, isolated scholarship has long been the norm, these new possibilities are also  driving the emergence of a new collaborative, team-based approach. These changes present a similar set of opportunities and imperatives to academic librarians.  If libraries are to continue to play their traditional role in scholarly support, and the enormous body of organization and expertise that libraries have assembled not be permitted to go to waste,  they need to embrace and become part of the new ways in which their patrons will increasingly be doing their work.   This is particularly true since many of the forces driving these changes are coming from outside the academy. In addition to their traditional roles as experts in the organization and retrieval of information, academic librarians need to become adept in supporting the ways that scholars work with that information, both in helping research to negotiate the complex terrain of intellectual property and varied formats that confront them as they assemble their collections, and to participate with them as they reshape, document, annotate, analyze, and republish that material.    They also need to develop the skills to participate as collaborative members of scholarly teams.  To be able to do so, they need to develop a good familiarity with the kinds of tools and techniques that are available to their scholarly patrons.  Indeed, just as librarians today are often the ones who bring knowledge of important information sources to faculty and students, it is perhaps reasonable to expect that the librarian of tomorrow can play the same role in advising researchers about the kinds of tools and techniques available to them.  The experience of library technology centers to date suggests that library users are frequently likely to turn to the librarian for support in these areas as readily as they long have for assistance with information resources. Acquiring such expertise requires a hands-on familiarity.  It is impossible to assist a patron with a citation management, markup, annotation, analysis, or communication tool unless one has used it oneself.  It is likewise difficult to participate effectively in a research team without direct experience of the research process. The Morningside project at Columbia represents an attempt to address this challenge.  It seeks to enable a team of history and humanities librarians to deepen their familiarity with the range of tools and techniques available to their patrons through collaborative participation in a scholarly research project of their own design.  The choice of subject, a documentary history of Morningside Heights, is one that brings together the common interests of a diverse team of specialists who nonetheless share a common interest in this city and this neighborhood.  The subject lends itself to use of a wide range of technology tools – for authoring, citation management, web publishing, annotation, analysis, publishing and communication – and a wide range of media and formats – text, image, audiovisual, statistical, and cartographical – make it well suited for such a training exercise.   The goal of producing a resource that can be shared with the broader community and can interface with the many efforts to document the history of this city, and the likelihood that the results will be of interest to many researchers adds a degree of commitment that can ensure serious collective involvement of all of us but also a great deal of satisfaction about the final outcome of our work. There are many directions that the work can take, and it will be part of developing our collaborative team skills to collectively determine exactly which of those we will chose as the work progresses.  A preliminary syllabus has been drawn up, but it is really just an inventory of the kinds of tools and resources we can address.

But there were two sites I stumbled across that intrigued me. One is All Our Ideas (allourideas.org), which combines surveys and crowdsourcing.  To a degree, it works kind of like Kitten War: under a given topic, two options pop up and you can vote on which you prefer; there is also an 'I Can't Decide' button, and a blank field where you can contribute your own idea, which makes the survey a constantly evolving entity.  As people vote on the successive pairs of options, the favored ideas bubble up to the top. The sample survey is one relevant to us all: it looks at options for a greener New York City.  It was difficult for me to STOP voting (I have a lot of opinions).  I'm not thinking this would be useful for the Morningside Heights project, but rather for the Developing Librarian project itself.  When we are faced with difficult decisions about where to go next, or what to prioritize, this site could help. The other tool that caught my attention is called Exploratree (www.exploratree.org.uk) (the play on words works better with a UK pronunciation).  It offers a series of templates--or, 'thinking guides'-- that help organize workflows for projects.  As wecontinue our collaborative work, it might help clarify our thinking to slot our tasks into one of the flowcharts on this site.

Bonus takeaway: apparently programmers love to have long flame wars about what is and isn't Object Oriented Programming, and whether it's good or evil! ",

    "content": " Our Design Team has been learning Adobe Illustrator and has been working in Illustrator on the creation of two logo options for our Morningside Heights history site. Today both logos were presented. One was relatively complete and the other was complete as a concept but had not yet been fully executed. The Design Team talked a bit about their process. They worked with guidance from Alex Gil; and when they encountered a question about how to accomplish something in Illustrator, they would typically enter the question in natural language in Google to see how it was answered in online forums concerning Illustrator. The potential drawbacks of the online forum approach were discussed. It can take an expert eye sometimes to recognize when a solution presented for a problem is the most efficient option. Other approaches to learning Illustrator were also discussed. The Lynda.com program on Illustrator lasts 12 hours, and can seem at times too detailed and exhaustive. Bob has ordered a book on Illustrator to offer another learning option. Issues relevant to the presentation and/or stability of logo designs were also discussed. A logo designed in Illustrator 5 on a PC looks different when presented in Illustrator 6 on a Mac. (Does this mean perhaps that we should try out how the logo appears on different devices?) Why did the Design Team choose to use Illustrator rather than the more accessible Photoshop? 1. Illustrator is grounded in mathematical approaches to images. Thus once a design is completed it can be easily and precisely scaled for different uses. 2. The point of our project is to learn new tools that library users working in the digital humanities might want to use. Anice presented one design and Karen another. Both designs made nods to the historical past in their visual elements. The group was impressed by both. Rather than making a final vote today it was decided that the Design Team would aim to have both logos complete for our next meeting on June 17. Due to the inordinate amount of time involved in working in Illustrator, the Design Team is planning to recruit someone in the Libraries with Illustrator expertise to assist them in bringing both logos to a state of completion. The group as a whole will then vote on which of the logo designs will be used for the project site. The timeline of tasks for the Design Team can accommodate this extension. After the logos they will turn their attention to their next projects: the design of header and footer for project site. In announcements and updates, Meredith mentioned that she had taken a tour of Riverside Church during which she had met a Columbia art history professor. He took an interest in our Morningside project when she described it, since he is having his students for a course this fall study two of the sites covered by our project: Riverside Church and the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine.

    "content": " At one of our last Morningside training sessions Kenny Crews discussed his recent presentations on copyright and DH. We explained our Developing Librarian Project and together we came up with a series of helpful recommendations concerning copyright and DH projects. Any discussion of copyright will be filled with nuances and 'what ifs,' but a lot of our conversation this time was about fair use and a search for a variety of practical steps one might take in building a DH project that pulls together a variety of copyrighted sources with attention to respecting the copyrights of others and managing the new copyright in the finished project. This post is not about the law. Readers can find more information about fair use and much more from the website of the Copyright Advisory Office. But the list of thoughts below are some practical ideas that might help respond to the copyright concerns. The law is far more complex than a blog post can allow, so the list below is a variety of 'first steps' to consider. Recommendations/Suggestions 1. Review and pick the CC license that is right for the project. Creative Commons can let you effectively share your work widely, and it can help prevent conflicting views among the various contributors. 2. Document that everyone in the group has agreed to the CC license using a spreadsheet and store the spreadsheet with the project files. There is a good chance everyone on the project has rights; clarifying agreement up front can avoid problems down the line. 3. Be selective about including 3rd party content in the project. You might want everything, but choosing only the materials that specifically advance your study can help with fair use. 4. Pick and display content in a manner indicating research and scholarship. Keep your eye on scholarship. That is why you are doing the project. 5. Images should be low resolution and of a small size. Fair use often centers on whether your use conflicts with the market for the original work; using only small and low-res images can reduce market harm. 6. Give credit where credit is due (practice responsible scholarship). Actually, credit is not a key part of copyright law, but it is almost always a good idea regardless. 7. Document group understandings in a charter that is posted along with the project.  Success comes from agreement, including agreement for how to manage and use the project in the future. 8. Keep thorough, ongoing records of all 3rd party content and provide citations. Very important. Cite sources and know where you found them. 9. Get copies of licenses and read and adhere to license agreements for source content. Many materials come from databases, or have CC licenses, or perhaps individual permission from copyright owners; keep permanent records of the permission and licenses. 10. Check current markets for content and avoid materials that are being actively marketed (actively seek out and use CC content). Watch for uses that might conflict with active markets for images, music, and other materials. If you can link to materials on the web, you are helping yourself and the copyright owners. These practical suggestions are no substitute for scrutinizing copyright, but they are a useful start. ",

    "content": " Though we haven't surfaced online in a while, the Design Team has been hard at work.  We have been perfecting logos and considering other sites to figure out what we wanted our design elements to resemble.  Here's where we are so far. We designed our logo to evoke a subway stop mosaic, using images found in Helvetica and the New York City subway system (MIT Press, 2011) as inspiration.  The logo comes in two sizes: one long and rectangular, with the full title, which will be on the header of the main page, and the other square, with only the acronym, for all child pages.  The color choices will be adapted when we finalize the palette of the site, but the general effect is this: We also identified the Morningside Heights map image that we want to use as the centerpiece of the main page: this comes from the 1891 Atlas of the city of New York, Manhattan Island (Phila.: Bromley):   This is not the full size, of course, but it gives the effect and, because it reaches from 105th to 125th Streets, and from Morningside Park to Riverside Park, it offers all the locations that our staff is working on. When it came to thinking about the site itself, we looked at Omeka themes, and were drawn to the charcoal, yellow, and red of 'Dark': ...but we were told that this particular theme doesn't offer the functionality we're going to require. We're going back to the drawing board for the theme, but we've been assured that whichever theme we choose, we''ll be able to modify it with this color scheme. When we began to think about how we wanted the page to look, we found some inspiration in other sites.  The Jan Brueghel Wiki inspired us to choose the 'Dark' Omeka theme, as it had that grey, yellow, and red color scheme we liked. That palette will also inform the colors of the logo, as mentioned above. The Medici Archive Project has a particularly lovely page. We liked the placement of the logo, and the serif font.  We also liked the large tabs for the header menu: and decided that our tabs would likely be: About Morningside History Images Bibliography Contact Us Columbia's own Mapping Gothic France page had the subtle, minimalist footer we preferred.  We were also intrigued by the thematic divisions of 'Space,' 'Time,' and 'Narrative,' and will be thinking more about that when we think about how we are going to create navigation paths. Finally, we were interested in the Digital Harlem: Everyday Life 1915-1930 site, from the University of Sydney, for obvious reasons. It, too, has a map as its focal point, although as a database, it has a much more complex search interface than we are likely to have. But it does give us a visual cue for how our page will eventually look. We have noticed that the cleanest pages, visually, follow a 2/3 to 1/3 rule, with a sidebar taking up the 1/3. Our sidebar will most likely offer a rolling list of news, blog post links, and tweets. And that's where we are in mid-August 2014. We have just a bit more refining to do, and then it's over to the Development Team! ",

The date ranges for our overall project have shifted several times, as we move the project forward. Currently, I believe we've defined the date range as ca. 1820-1950, so, that will provide ample range to investigate the transformative effects of the arrival of the Interborough Rapid Transit (IRT), which opened in 1904. One resource that I'm very much looking forward to consulting is the (perhaps somewhat obsessive) series of books on the history of the subway and individual subway stations, 'Silver Connections' by Philip Ashforth Coppola (a.k.a. Philip Copp). The series is self-published, ongoing, and available in limited copies. Luckily for me, Avery holds a copy: http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=314585. The books include detailed illustrations by the author, highlighting many architectural details from subway stations, and is an attempt to describe the entire NYC subway system.

J.F. Richmond's 1872 'New York and Its Institutions'.  (http://clio.cul.columbia.edu:7018/vwebv/holdingsInfo?bibId=6182272) John Leake had bequeathed his estate to Robert Watts, the third son of John Watts, on the condition that he change his name to Leake; if not, the money would go to establish an orphan asylum, open to children regardless of nationality or religion.  Robert died while in the process of changing his name (he caught a fever while  playing baseball) and John Watts undertook to set up the asylum.  It was originally downtown, but moved to Morningside Heights in 1843;  it sold the Morningside property in 1888 to St. John the Divine, and, in 1891, moved to Yonkers, where it still exists.

Neatline is a stronger tool for humanistic data and approaches than other mapping/timeline tools, as it allows 'fuzzier' boundaries and definitions; 3. although it is designed as a plugin for Omeka, Neatline projects can be run 'stand-alone', without Omeka, although Omeka still needs to be installed; 4. georectification of maps is a technique to synchronize the visual presentation of different-sized maps in layers, so that key locations line up (more or less).

    "content": " French librarian graduating from Enssib (the French National Library School), training and interning at Columbia University Libraries for three months, from February to the beginning of May 2015, I was lucky enough to be given the opportunity to join the Developing Librarian Project and to become part of the developing team. This experience has been very rewarding for a number of reasons and will reverberate on my practices and on the way I see librarianship and the role of libraries and librarians now and in years to come. What facets of the experience proved to be prominent for me? Many aspects are involved in this project, the goal of which is to reskill ourselves to support evolving modes of scholarship in the humanities (see the article published by Nikka Bakkalbasi, Damon Jaggars and Barbara Rockenbach in Library Management (Volume 36, Issue 3), entitled Re-skilling for the digital humanities: measuring skills, engagement, and learning). I would like to focus on the day-to-day experience: what does it feel like to be a developing librarian on a daily basis and to set out on this journey? In this respect, the few aspects of the Developing Librarian Project that especially stand out in my view are a special stance on research and scholarship produced by librarians as a team, the development of technical skills on the go, and the team building experience. Getting involved in A Digital History of Morningside Heights implies, of course, a fair amount of research and scholarship. I took over from Mary Cargill and chose to deal with the Leake and Watts Orphan House, the remains of which can still be seen appending the Cathedral of St John the Divine. It seemed interesting to focus on various aspects: first, the creation of the house itself, which stemmed from a strange will, the architecture, at the same time typical and strangely unrecognized, the rural feel surrounding the building that was considered as so pleasant, and the welcoming policies and living conditions of the orphan residents. What is left of the Leake and Watts Orphan House on the Morningside Plateau, April 2015 Focusing on the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum, which was set up on the Morningside Heights Plateau in 1843, implied turning to 19th century newspapers to retrieve pictures and to understand how the mission of the Orphan House was perceived by the contemporaries. It also meant turning to material like censuses or, strangely enough, travel guides. Finding this material is, of course, a matter of thorough research through the databases. However, working in a team together focusing on different items with different approaches creates a seminal serendipity: going through a database for one’s own research, one stumbles on material that pertains to another item in the project that the team member has not noticed because their sources and approaches are different. Travel guides in the 1850s happen to mention the Leake and Watts Orphan House among other orphanages and along with the Bloomingdale Asylum as places to visit, for instance, an unexpected mention that came up through research but also through exchanges with the other team members using this resource. The bimonthly Morningside Heights meetings enabling every member to present their items are a means of creating a unity in the whole project, while respecting each and every member’s chosen angle: a common object is designed, which is not only the product of a community but which also creates a sense of community just through the way the library staff can appropriate the history of Columbia itself. Contributing to the digital history of Morningside Heights implies reskilling oneself and developing technical skills that can be learned from online tuition (html, css), but that also have to be practiced and mastered on the go, day after day. If online lessons are useful, progress comes from learning tips from your coworker in workshops targeted at building up the final Omeka website. It all amounts to learning by doing and to appropriating the tool step by step, and, what’s more, to appropriating it together and for a common purpose. More than from learning from an online learning platform, a sensible use of the tool results from building up the html and the css together, through trial and error. What comes as a surprise is that even the less advanced can contribute to building the final product. Answering questions also enables the respondents in the team to make sure that they master a set aspect of coding. To me, the main asset of this learning process is the way it contributes to building team spirit. Team spirit does not just come from any project carried out together: it stems from the sense of purpose that the learning process eventually acquires in this case. Becoming a developing librarian for a while also amounted for me to developing into a librarian proper and to contributing to a team intent on rethinking libraries as constantly evolving libraries.

    "content": " The Developing Librarian Project began in the spring of 2012 with the notion of “re-skilling” or training librarians in the Columbia University Libraries Humanities & History team, most of whom have spent their careers as subject liaisons, with the specific knowledge and skills necessary to support digital scholarship. Two recent studies in particular have highlighted the gaps in librarian skills in relation to new research needs: the Research Libraries UK report 'Re-Skilling for Research' and the Ithaka S+R History study ('Support Services for Scholars: History Project Interim Report'). Both studies cite the need for librarians to better understand data management and the tools and methods being used by researchers. The turn to digital in humanities scholarship has been significant. Yet, this change in research behavior has not been accompanied by a major change in the profession of librarianship. While many reference desks are now virtual rather than physical, more research materials are purchased through automated approval plans, and the majority of materials acquired are digital, the fundamental service model of librarianship has not changed. Librarians are still being trained to assist scholars in their research process by purchasing materials, helping with discovery of those materials, and preserving the materials for future generations of scholars. The staff of digital humanities centers or labs sited in libraries are most often comprised of humanities scholars, Web developers, and programmers. Librarians are sometimes included on staff, but more frequently they serve as consultants on specific projects rather than as full-time members of the center. We will be exploring the idea of a service model for DH with librarians at the center rather than at the margins, envisioning librarians as full collaborators in the scholarly process. ",

Cognitive noise on historic map. Leak and Watts is in foreground. Level playing field with newer map. Historical map misleading. Historical map not compatible with Neatline. Narrative Ian wrote describes the historic map. Could we link from the main page to the historic map via a tab? Design team chose colors for the historic map. Phase one of project never intended an interactive map. We talked phase 2 having a Neatline interactive map. Several weeks ago Alex offered to create an interactive map for his project. Disagree that this map will make the site more interactive. Aesthetic and technical issues with this map. Site is about building a narrative about Morningside Heights. Preference for historic map that pre-dates Columbia. Could we use a static historic map and list institutions on the the side? Is it possible to have interactive maps in the exhibits? Could there be an interactive map tab with historic map on front page? Could historic map link directly to interactive map? Historic map on left with list of exhibits on the right. Prototype of this solution by Wednesday, July 8 Use CUL/IS header but with no 'My Library Account' or 'Help' - get rid of Use current logo with historic map Also, would like to revisit color and spacing of chapter titles within exhibits 2.

    "content": " As we move forward with our process in developing new skills, I am thinking about how best to evaluate new technologies. Advice suggests we shouldn't get overly enamored without first thinking about how that new technology applies to what we hope to achieve. Advice also suggests we need to test new technologies to see how well they do the job. I think this is interesting.  New technologies are developed at a fast rate -- and what is already available is overwhelming in numbers and scope. The way we do things is changing at a fast rate. I would like us to define criteria for evaluation or define reliable resources that can help us evaluate new tools and applications. We need to clearly understand what it is the student or faculty member is hoping to achieve -- in addition to advising and recommending traditional resources from our collections -- we are adding a new layer -- we need to understand the application. I really like the website Bamboo Dirt -- the main page offers 'I need a digital research tool to....' -- I think this is a great approach. But when somebody wants to start blogging -- and the three main blogging tools out there -- Blogger, Wordpress and Tumblr -- it becomes a more detailed evaluation to decide which is going to work better. I just read somewhere that Google searches on Tumblr have now surpassed other blogs. Well, if having your site discoverable is of most importance -- then this might help decide to go with Tumblr. Librarians are comfortable in this environment -- our service model has always focused on helping folks find what they need. It was reassuring to me to read the statement agreed upon by the American Association of University Professors stating that librarians continue to serve a vital role in helping faculty and students -- we advise and assist in scholarly pursuit. Forgive this rambling post -- stream of thought very early this morning. ",

It has been a month since we've all met; it was good to be together again. Assignment 1: - You should have a working version of Omeka running on your virtual servers independent of the one on GitHub. This includes a working MAMP or LAMP, a database, omeka software install, db.ini file configured. - Your git should be working and you should be able to synch with https://github.com/elotroalex/devlib.git Assignment 2: - Someone change the readme.md page to reflect our project (rather than the Omeka boilerplate) and push it to github. Everyone else should pull it. - Someone create a branch named design and push it. Everyone should pull it. - Working on the design branch, someone change the background color on the style.css. Remember we are working with the default theme, called Thanks, Roy, so far. The style.css folder is to be found there. Push it. The rest pull. - This is a good opportunity for you to start understand how Omeka works in the back end. You can start by understanding Default Theme Files and Theme Writing Best Practices. Assignment 3: - Put in an 'issue' on github. It doesn't have to be real, but extra cookies for putting something down that we actually need to do eventually. - Create an item on your individual installations. Then backup the database. - Create a branch called playground, and break the site. Yes. Break it. Whoever breaks it first wins. I am slowly getting a feel for Git.  At first, it was hard for me to parse the error messages.  I would search them verbatim on the internet, but then felt I was blindly typing in the suggested commands without understanding what I was doing.  The error messages and the excellent help pages on the Github site are now starting to make sense.   This morning we were all editing our style.css files pretty much at the same time, so I understand why I got error messages when trying to pull from the design branch.   I still need to work out the git sequences (add, commit, push, -m) to avoid the error messages, but I feel that it is coming.

Fair Use affects all of us as librarians and scholars, but especially in the context of this project, as we are delving into researching various landmarks and buildings in Morningside Heights. Some of us are fortunate in that the published documents and images of our institutions pre-date 1923 and fall squarely into the public domain, while others (myself included), have to understand what constitutes fair use when it comes to newspaper articles, photographs, and other items published in 1930 or later. As such, I appreciate all of the freely available resources on Fair Use, so I''m sharing two that have been really helpful to me: ",

    "content": " This week we've scheduled two 'Open Labs' in the Studio@Butler, the library's collaboratory. Because of the modular furniture in the Studio we're able to work individually or break into smaller groups to discuss shared research interests and resources. Since we are all struggling to find time to research our individual landmarks/buildings in Morningside Heights, we're using these Open Labs as dedicated time to research and write outside of our normal training sessions and meetings. For me personally, it's helpful to work in a room full of other people working, even if we're not all doing the same thing. The energy and the buzz in the room definitely enhances my productivity, while taking short breaks to find out which resources my colleagues are currently exploring can be really inspiring! In Tuesday's Open Lab, Bob and Sarah showed us some of the fascinating census documents they've been extracting from Ancestry.com, as well as underlying spreadsheets and data that give us a better understanding of the neighborhood's changing demographics in the late 19th and early 20th century. John and Anice also spent some time investigating Gateway to North America: people, places, and organizations of 19th-century New York, a database that includes directories and travel guides among other primary sources. These Open Labs follow a successful 'researchathon' that Alex and I organized for a faculty member in the French department last week. She is compiling a bibliography on literature, colonization and slavery in the Atlantic so we got several colleagues together from across the libraries and spent a few hours researching and adding citations to a Zotero group. We ended up with a bibliography of over 300 sources, having split our time between working individually and in small groups concentrating on themes like 'Early American Travel Narratives' and 'Natural History and Slavery.' These sorts of collaborative initiatives have not only brought us together and helped us foster closer partnerships with our academic departments, but they belie the notion that humanities research is conducted purely by individuals working in isolation. We're all still spending plenty of time independently researching our selected locations for this project but I (and my colleagues) are increasingly valuing these Open Labs and researchathons as opportunities to create an interdisciplinary community of researchers at the university.

    "content": " Our agenda for the July 1 meeting focused on our individual research projects and an update from the research team. Before we began our discussion, we welcomed a visitor -- Anna Kijas from the University of Connecticut. Anna is interested in the Developing Librarian Project as a model for UCONN and a new initiative to support digital scholarship projects. We gave Anna the floor to hear more about her interest in our project and how they are moving forward at UCONN. She is involved with the Scholar''s Collaborative which was approved in December 2013 as a permanent service to help faculty and students with digital projects. Most of the projects have been focused in humanities disciplines but they also work with researchers in the social sciences and sciences. Anna helped to to set up a program for subject specialists to learn new skills related to digital scholarship. The format of the program included six workshops throughout the year. We look forward to staying in touch with Anna and sharing developments as we move forward with the Developing Librarian. We moved to the agenda as planned and presented on our individual research topics. Mary Cargill: I am researching the Leake and Watts Orphan asylum because I want to find out the criteria for identifying and the treatment of orphans in order for the reader to understand how New York treated the growing populations of needy children. Nancy Friedland: I am researching St. Luke’s Hospital because I want to find out why it located in Morningside Heights and explore the hospital’s relationship to Columbia University in order for my reader to understand the role of a hospital to a community and development as a teaching hospital. Alex Gil: I am researching the history of residential and business changes on 110th Street around the turn of the century because I want to find out the impact that Columbia and St. John's had on southern Morningside Heights in order for my reader to understand to what extent these institutions shaped modern day everyday life in Morningside Heights. Karen Green: I am researching the Lion Brewery because I want to find out how it operated, for how long, and by whom, as well as how it figured in neighborhood and city life in order for my reader to understand the role of a major commercial/industrial entity in the development of Morningside Heights. Meredith Levin: I am researching the history of Riverside Church, focusing especially on its visual culture, the Weekday School, and its involvement in WWII because I want to find out how the church's relationship with the Morningside Heights community has evolved over time in order for my reader to understand how diverse groups of people are connected to the daily activities of Riverside Church, which has been important presence in the neighborhood since it was founded 80 years ago. Anice Mills: I am researching the history of Riverside Park because I want to find out how the value of public parks (as sanctuary, open space) influenced urban culture in order for my reader to understand the development of the Morningside Heights community within the larger urban environment. Nick Patterson: I am researching the IRT subway line's history, because I want to find out about its history and development in Morningside Heights, from inception to 1950, in order for my reader to understand how this development impacted Morningside Heights, through a focus on the subway stops at 110th, 116th, and 125th streets. Bob Scott: I am researching the history of the Bloomingdale Asylum, focusing especially on the positive and negative elements in its functioning as one of the leading psychiatric institutions in 19th-century America and on its role in shaping the early environment of Morningside Heights in order to give readers a clearer and more lively picture of this neighborhood in the “pre-Columbian” era. John Tofanelli: I am researching the history of the Cathedral Church of St John the Divine because I want to find out how the significance of the cathedral was described and how its design was envisioned and realized from 1892 (when its cornerstone was laid) through 1946 (when Bishop William Thomas Manning retired) in order for my reader to understand how the cathedral was variously envisioned during the period in which most of its building was completed. Sarah Witte: I am researching the Croton Aqueduct 113th Street gatehouse (1876) and the adjacent Engine Company No. 47 firehouse(1890) to learn more about the infrastructure development in the 19th century that supported the growth of our neighborhood in order for my reader to understand the the role that the aqueduct and the fire department played in the early development of the neighborhood. I am also very interested in learning how to parse census data for our neighborhood, so may also look at census data for the entire block of 113th Street from Amsterdam to Broadway before 1900. Next on the agenda, Mary Cargill reported for the Research Team. She is available to meet with anyone as a consultation to review the literature in our individual subjects. She came prepared with excellent resources for everyone in attendance. She reported that she met with Anice to discuss Riverside Park and reported on a productive research session. Mary will meet with Bob, Nancy and John to review Zotero as the best citation management system for arranging the bibliography for the final project. ",

    "content": " The Development Team met yesterday to reinforce our understanding of how to use GitHub to share our code and to try implementing some of the recommendations we received from the Design team with regard to our site. We established a list of rules for using Git that we are all committed to memorizing (or else we risk breaking branches, destroying the site, and creating extra work for ourselves). The rules are: 1. Pull before you push- any time we sit down to work on the code for the site we should remember to pull the code on each of our branches to ensure that we receive all the changes our colleagues have made and that we don't end up with conflicts. 2. Don't pull another branch into the Master branch- we want to keep the master branch clean! 3. Always check what branch you're on whenever you make any changes (so that everyone else knows which branch to switch to when they are pulling the updates). 4. In order to delete other branches, you must be on the Master branch. 5. We don''t pull files- we're only pulling code. 6. Don't use capital letters or spaces in file names. We also discovered, thanks to Alex and another colleague in the libraries, Seth Robertson's choose your own adventure guides to Git, http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitPostProduction/gpp.html, and the one we''ll probably use the most (since it helps you resolve merge conflicts and committing errors): http://sethrobertson.github.io/GitFixUm/fixup.html Once we had nailed down this set of rules to live and program by, we moved on to editing the CSS for our site's homepage. We were able to insert a title into the header and to create a background image for the entire homepage. Our next steps will be centering the title, changing the font and size, and attempting to insert a navigation menu toward the bottom of the page. This all may sound very cryptic or, to those who are very familiar with coding and with Git, very basic, but having these rules crystallized has been extremely helpful for our team as we move forward in building the site.

A number of our team's meetings have also included Alex Gil, our Digital Scholarship Coordinator, who is something of an ex officio member. Initially, I viewed the role of project manager with some misgivings. Does this person go around when elements of the project are due, knocking on people's doors, and saying (like T.S. Eliot's anonymous pub keeper) 'HURRY UP PLEASE ITS TIME'? Happily, our experience has been quite different from that. Each team has embraced its tasks with energy and true inventiveness. A real synergy has developed to the point at which I feel qualified to sketch out four lessons in project management. 1. Think carefully about what needs to be accomplished for the initial launch of the project. Make sure that all of these tasks (and nothing more) are covered in the timeline of task deadlines. Devote time, thought, and expertise to considering how tasks relate to one another (for example, does one necessarily precede another, does one need to be accomplished along with another) and which tasks belong to which teams. 2. Open up the project timeline to a group discussion with all project participants. Be open to adding, redefining, or reordering tasks as needed. Let participants develop a sense of ownership in the project timeline. 3. Listen, observe, encourage. It is key that teams meet on their own time in order to accomplish tasks. Nevertheless, a regular schedule of group meetings with all participants remains essential. This is where teams can report on their progress, listen to one another, ask for feedback from the group, and demonstrate accomplishments. 4. Facilitate synergy. ",

    "content": " We on the Development Team (Meredith, Sarah, Bob, and Nick) have been learning how to use the command line to connect to GitHub, install Omeka, and become developers-in-training. It has been a challenging and exciting time as we are all entering a world that is pretty foreign to us. We are each using our personal laptops, mostly Macs with one PC mixed in, which has given us a lot of freedom to experiment and reduced our anxiety about somehow destroying library servers/networks. One of the most important lessons that we’ve been learning (and re-learning) is that it is really okay to fail. In fact, we’ve discovered that failure is a healthy, necessary part of the development process: fixing mistakes and troubleshooting problems are essential components of any successful project. From downloading and running MAMP, to creating local databases in myPHPadmin, to figuring out how to clone a git repository and then install local versions of Omeka, we have run into all sorts of complications. And even though development can often be a solitary process, with many developers working in isolation, we have found that weekly meetings provide us with a much-needed forum to ask questions, demonstrate troubleshooting options, and commiserate over our repeated error messages. Mastering the vocabulary associated with the various programs and commands we’ve been using has felt a lot like learning a new language. In order to share the knowledge we are individually accumulating (and document our struggles), we created a shared folder in Google Drive where we keep a running list of defined terms, answered questions, and the steps that were followed to achieve certain results. All of our successes were born out of much trial and error so enumerating each step provides a baseline for others to follow and helps us keep in mind that all of our actions are connected to a bigger picture. For me personally, this process has been an exercise in patience and perseverance. A few weeks ago GitHub and Omeka were abstract concepts to me; they belonged to the realm of the ‘computer people’ of whom I was not one. Now I know not only what they mean but how to use them to make our project a reality. It's very empowering! We are all looking forward to delving deeper into both GitHub and Omeka and will hopefully have more to share very soon! ",

We have split into teams and devised a timeline--not for THIS site but for the site that will eventually be the public face of the Morningside Heights project: i.e., the end product of all this training.  The teams are Project Management, Design, Development, and Research.  Each team has a leader: I'm the leader of the Design Team. Our mission: design the logo, header and footer; layout the homepage and any auxiliary pages; choose fonts and color schemes; create the credits. At our first meeting, team members focused on logo design.  What is going to be the essential image that represents the project?  We brainstormed ideas; one of our members had a folder of reference logos for us to think about--will it go across the top? Down the side? Incorporate an iconographic element that instantly encapsulates the endeavor? We agreed each to go off and develop one idea we liked, on paper.  On April 10th, we'll meet and compare the ideas; then we'll vote and choose the one we like best. Once the winning design emerges, we have scheduled an Adobe Illustrator training session for April 17, in order to devise as many variations on the winning design as possible. We'll then present these variants on a theme to the entire group: do we want the fonts compacted or elongated? Do we want the design components in heavy or light outline? Do we want the site title on one line or two? The deadline for that presentation is our April 29th meeting.  The group as a whole will vote on the winning variant--and then we'll have our logo.  The logo design, to a certain extent, drives the design of the header and footer, which is also due on April 29th. So...check back with us at the end of the month--perhaps we'll reveal the winning design! Or...perhaps we'll wait until we can debut the entire site.  It will be a group decision: we're very democratic! ",

    "content": " The Project management Team (Nancy Friedland and John Tofanelli) met on Monday to discuss how the Humanities and History team should best move forwards on our Morningside Heights Digital History (MHDH) project in light of our pending deadline for the initial launch of our public site--January 1, 2015. Here are our decisions: * Downsize specifications for initial launch of public site. Our present guidelines for initial launch specify that each author should contribute three exhibits (that is, multimedia essays) for his/her chosen building or location plus twenty items with metadata, some of which should be in support of those exhibits, some of which can simply enhance the site overall. We have decided that the specifications for initial launch shall be revised as follows: one exhibit plus eight items with metadata from each author. * We will leave it up to the MHDH team to decide at our 11/18 meeting who would like to add content beyond the initial launch specifications, what sort of content they would like to add, and within what time frame. * The Project Management Team will meet with the heads of the Design Team (Karen Green) and the Development Team (Meredith Levin) prior to our 11/18 meeting to clarify how those groups will be working together to complete the architecture of the public site. * In both of the meetings described in bullets immediately above, the Project Management Team will seek input needed to assess if the January 1, 2015 initial launch deadline is feasible. * In order to provide the Design Team and Development Team a sample exhibit page to work with, John Tofanelli will author an exhibit page for his chosen building by 11/17. Considerations: As stated in a poster about our project that was recently exhibited by MHDH team members at the Digital Library Federation meeting in Atlanta: 'The project is important, but the process of learning emergent technologies . . . is equally, if not more, important than the product.' The entire MHDH team is in agreement with this viewpoint. Our Project Management Team felt strongly that respecting the original deadline for the project, insofar as possible, would provide all with a welcome sense of accomplishment. Downsizing the scope of the initial launch specifications, furthermore, would create a goal within reach that would provide each team member with an inspiration for the completion of work in progress. It remains the intention of the Project Management Team to work with the MHDH team to maintain fully the integrity of the project. Full attention will still be given to issues of metadata, site architecture and design, content, and functionality. We will aim to find and implement workable answers for the questions regarding these issues that have arisen throughout our work on the project. It will simply be a smaller site at the point of initial launch--one that may grow as and if members of the team choose to continue adding on to it. Overall, we hope that other librarians engaged in project-based learning of new skills might find our example useful. Integrity and quality remain accessible goals--regardless of the sweep and scope of a project. Sometimes sweep and scope need to be reined in so that learning objectives can be attained. ",

As we move into the nuts and bolts of building our Omeka site, we wanted a lesson in how the organization builds exhibitions for the public. CUL has 29 Omeka exhibits. The library chose Omeka platform because it is free, open-source software with an active development community; it is easy to use; and staff can build exhibitions containing digital assets and metadata. In the future, all items in Omeka exhibitions will go into our Fedora institutional repository. The Image Lab in the library will digitize objects from our collections for the Morningside project. To do this, the Image Lab needs a spreadsheet listing all items for imaging. This spreadsheet also doubles as our metadata record. By using the spreadsheet we can bulk upload our metadata into an Omeka exhibit and also populate the Fedora repository. Image Lab creates archival tiffs and jpg derivatives. To get the project started, we will submit the Gallery Planning Form to newproject@libraries.cul.columbia.edu prior to beginning work on an exhibition for the Morningside project. Complete metadata is important for discoverability. Most Omeka creators in the Columbia library do not enter metadata directly into Omeka, but use a spreadsheet instead. I have created a shared Google spreadsheet Morningside — objects & metadata for our project. Please begin putting items you find in our collections into the spreadsheet. The Libraries Digital Program Division (LDPD) is currently working on implementing the Omeka | Fedora connector. The goal is to upgrade to Omeka 2.0 and integrate Neatline this summer.

    "content": " For our history of Morningside Heights, I have chosen to concentrate on the Bloomingdale Asylum, which is interesting for a number of reasons.  From its establishment in the Heights until well into the 19th century, it was the single most prominent landmark in the area, occupying the high ground that is today Columbia's campus. For a number of years, buildings of the Bloomingdale remained alongside the University's, and one of them, now known as Buell Hall, is still standing today. The Bloomingdale was also an important and interesting institution in its own right. It was one of the best known mental hospitals in America, and its name served as an emblem for all mental hospitals, much the way the terms 'Bedlam,' 'Charenton,' or 'Bellevue' have functioned in other times and places. Like all such institutions, its history was a checkered one: on the one hand, some literature hails its humane modern methods, while other writers point to the inevitable abuses that were likely to occur in and around such a facility. Modern and postmodern scholarship has become increasingly sensitive to the ways in which institutions of involuntary incarceration and definitions of mental illness have functioned as expressions of deeper societal and cultural issues, and so it is surprising, perhaps, that the Bloomingdale has not yet been the subject of a contemporary monograph. I hope in this project to bring together the materials that some researcher might want to use for just such a study.

    "content": " The Design Team learned about a new concept this month: wireframes.  These are detailed layouts of what a webpage (home page and interior pages) will look like.  To our dismay, the scribbled pen-and-ink rendition we'd generated just wasn't enough: Gosh, wasn't that clear? Apparently not. We met with Alex, from the Development Team, to create a PowerPoint slide that would give a better sense of what we envisioned.  The Development Team had taken our map image: and made it golden, to match the border in our original logo: Those colors had just been placeholders, however, as when we designed the logo we hadn't settled conclusively on our color scheme.  The Design Team was still enamored of yellow and red on charcoal grey, as seen on the Jan Brueghel wiki site.  We had applied this to our logo design, and envisioned it as yellow text on a charcoal grey background, with a dark crimson border.  On Monday December 15, we met with Alex to learn how to change the color. Alex matched the yellow of the map for our text, but we had a difficult time identifying a red that pleased us.  The complementary colors suggested by color wheel sites online were not attractive.  The Design Team made an executive decision to thrown color-wheel logic to the winds and just choose a red we liked.  We didn't find one that made us 100% happy--most were more cherry than crimson--but we found one that would do for the sake of the wireframe. We made box shapes and text boxes that could move independently of each other, learned how to make colors transparent, and played with the 2/3-1/3 split.  At a meeting of the entire division this morning, we honed things a little more (abandoning a fifth tab to be called 'Morningside History,' after realizing it was redundant; and deciding to place the links to exhibits in the righthand 1/3 of the page instead, after learning that the feeds we'd hoped to place there wouldn't work with our platform).  In the end, it looked a little like this: The Design Team was asked if we were wedded to this color scheme; if the scheme was significant in some way for Morningside Heights.  It wasn't: we just liked it.  But there was a general feeling that that original map had more interesting colors: and we began to wonder if it might be better to return to it, and perhaps borrow colors from it for the logo. Another option was to use the original map in negative, which fits with the charcoal background of the site, and would make the red and yellow text accents pop even more: The entire exercise was a terrific lesson for the Design Team in managing expectations.  While the general wireframe for the homepage (we didn't even get to the exhibit page yet!) was warmly received, we learned about what our platform could and couldn't do, and what the entire team was happiest with. More to come! ",

    "content": " I was curious to see how Omeka sites have illustrated population growth and other changes over time.  I was hoping to find something similar to the Pastmapper site about Greenwich Village, which takes a street in Greenwich village and incorporates census and building data.  It is not an Omeka site, but I very much like the way it works. I'd love to do something similar for a block in Morningside Heights. I looked for Omeka sites that incorporate census data.  In Digital Amherst, Peoples of Amherst gives a very general description of antebellum population growth and links to the 1790 census list from Rootsweb.  The site does not have a time-line, but instead uses tags for decades and centuries.  The Eastern Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium also includes images of the 1930 manuscript census listing patients and staff residing at the sanatorium. Then I decided to look for sites that use maps to show change over time.  Neatline is a suite of Omeka plugins designed by the Scholars Lab that could help us show how Morningside Heights changed from 1850 to 1920 by allowing us to combine maps, images, and text, and display them dynamically.   Other Neatline features include a time line and the ability to easily upload data in CSV format.  It would be great to upload a CSV file of information on the buildings in neighborhood, including name, height, architect, builder, owner, number of apartments, etc. I also looked at Viewshare, which is not an Omeka plug in, but which can embedded in an Omeka site.  The website has a great view using the Cason Monk-Metcalf data set, a collection of funeral home records.

    "content": " We were talking yesterday about the purpose of our Morningside Heights historical Web site. What is the overarching vision or the story we are trying to tell? How do we impart any kind of vision to users? One suggestion was that we include narrative elements--for example each compiler of a collection could include an essay about the materials gathered in that collection. In my sampling of Sites Using Omeka, therefore, I was on the lookout for sites that had a strong narrative bent. The one that I find most versatile and appealing is Frontier to Heartland: Making History in Central North America, created by the Newberry Library, Chicago. The title of the site already advises us that a story is being told. And the title is followed by an entirely clear statement of scope and purpose of the site: 'Based on the world-renowned collections of the Newberry Library in Chicago, 'Frontier to Heartland' offers access to historical primary sources, scholarly perspectives on the past, and resources to help you use the site.' One component in 'Frontier to Heartland' is called 'Perspectives: Essays with a Point of View.' These are enormously helpful as a way of approaching the materials on the site. Very accessible, but not simplistic, accompanied by judiciously selected illustrations, these 'Perspectives' essays offer the user a range of options for thinking about and exploring the materials on the site. The image Galleries are thematically grouped with some commentary on each theme. For users who want simply to explore images on their own, there is an Images module, in which the images can be sorted by date, place, etc. What I like here is the versatility. There is a combination of guided modules and user-controlled modules. In a Web environment that can surround us with endless compilations of images and information, items and exhibits, it is often possible for the user to feel like Ruth amid the alien corn. When a site is nicely conceived and managed, as 'Frontier to Heartland' is, it provides crucial elements of orientation and perspective. These are needed if a wide range of users are going to find meaningful ways of approaching the materials. I consider those elements of orientation and perspective to be the digital equivalent of a familiar analog object--the humble Welcome Mat. ",

Librarians have traditionally been concerned with the interface of users to information, of course, but this area seems to me to take on new dimensions in the digital sphere. We've all seen a parade of poorly-designed interfaces from vendors, and we, as expert users, know that they could do better. I suspect that we've also all seen flashy digital projects, that failed when the shortcomings of the user interface design became apparent. One theme seems to be that we librarians are often the last people asked about effective interfaces (if we're asked at all), whereas this is our natural turf, where we can shine. I think part of our defining future roles in digital projects will be asserting our authority in this area, marketing what we have to offer as organizers of information; the challenge, and one of the good things about conducting a project such as ours, is to become knowledgeable enough to have the conversations on technology with our various project partners, so that we can take control of what's going on 'under the hood' of digital projects, and make sure that the information infrastructure is there to allow the fullest and most effective access to users.

    "content": " A tool that I did not just discover on Bamboo Dirt but that I find very useful and frequently recommend to our researchers is Ant Conc.  It is a traditional concordancing program that is easy to use and allows one to quickly start exploring the contents of a large file or text collection.  This is a classic kind of tool that has been around for a long time, but is still relatively unknown to most of our researchers, and hence is worth publicizing in our instruction. Quickly downloadable to your desktop, it allows you to index multiple files in text format and then to quickly create a word frequency list for the corpus, to create a concordance for one or more words in that corpus, to sort the concordance to by the words that occur to the left or right of the word(s) being studied, and to identify the phrases using that word that occur most frequently in the text. The availability of regular expression syntax in the search provides a powerful tool for creating a set of terms to study.  One can plot the occurrence of the selected terms over the corpus (think of the word 'white' in Moby Dick, for instance), and map collocations for the words -- i.e. the words that most frequently occur around your hit terms (a kind of connotative penumbra, if you will). The tool also enables you to compare the frequencies of terms in your corpus with another 'reference corpus,' to get a better sense of the most distinctive features of its vocabulary.  Hence, it is valuable not only for exploring the contents of a specific text, but comparing sets of texts with one another. Ant conc is also very useful when one is trying to do some quality control on a large text that has been scanned and read using Abbyy FineReader at the DHC. It can help one to identify some of the characteristic errors that the software has made and therefore to correct them globally with search and replace commands. I have been using it to good effect during the past few days to clean up some texts of medieval Polish charters downloaded from Hathi Trust for use in the CHARTEX project. It takes just a moment to download the program and run it. Since it is an `exe` file, it does require administrative control of the machine (since running an `exe` file from an unknown source is a good way to get a virus). Hence, we will need the approval and help of our IT folks to put it on our work machines, but we and our readers can have it up and running on our own machines in just a second.

    "content": " This Sunday, I took the first of what will probably be many tours of the Riverside Church. I've been trying to think about what my three exhibits will be and it has been difficult to decide what to focus on since so many aspects of the church's history are rich and fascinating. John D. Rockefeller's money and vision, Harry Emerson Fosdick's controversial ecumenical beliefs, and the architects' Gothic design hiding a modern steel framework all deserve extensive treatment. Because these have already been well-documented (in Dolkart and elsewhere), I'm leaning instead toward focusing on the details that most interest me: its visual culture, including stained glass windows, paintings, and sculptures, especially the impressive chancel screen and building facade; the evolution of its Weekday School for young children; and its role in the community during World War II. Visual Culture at Riverside Church The beauty of the building is undeniable. But what I find so charming about the Riverside Church is the mixture of Old and New World elements, varying styles and themes. It is a Gothic cathedral with clerestory windows and a chancel labyrinth modeled on those in the cathedral in Chartres, France, but its Christ Chapel is built in the Romanesque style, after the 11th-century nave of St. Nazaire in Carcassonne. Much of the stained glass is contemporary, including one window that honors the workers who helped make the church a reality (sculptors, artisans, carpenters), although the narthex features two remarkable 16th-century Flemish windows illustrating events and parables in the life of Christ. The windows are believed to be from a church that had been threatened or destroyed during the French Revolution and were dug up in a field in Bruges in the 19th century! Chancel floor maze, one of a few such medieval designs in the world! (Image Credit: Meredith Levin) Nave of Riverside Church (Image Credit: Meredith Levin) The Weekday School Established in 1930 by Florence Allen Whitney Fosdick, the wife of Riverside's first pastor, the Weekday School (formerly known as the Nursery-Kindergarten Weekday School) is one of the oldest and most successful early childhood education programs in New York City. Mrs. Fosdick was dedicated to serving the local population of Morningside Heights- upon her death in 1964, it was asked that in lieu of flowers contributions should be made to a fund in her name that would permanently support the school (Miller 300). While the Weekday School's original purpose was to provide care and education for the young children (ages 2-6) of working women, it is now a prestigious, tuition-based program that can cost upwards of $20,000 a year. The school maintains its original nondenominational and multicultural approach to education but one wonders how Mrs. Fosdick would feel about today's elite private enterprise. Riverside Church and World War II Harry Emerson Fosdick served as the pastor of Riverside Church from 1930-1946, seeing his congregants through much of the Great Depression and World War II, despite his personal beliefs as a pacifist. In May 1935, Fosdick joined 250 ministers and rabbis who met at Riverside Church and recited a pledge that their religious beliefs could not be reconciled with war (Sittser 24). Fosdick often delivered anti-war sermons, and published his famous 'Keeping Christ Above the Strife' in January 1941 in response to The Christian Century's question, 'If America is drawn into war, can you, as a Christian participate in it or support it?' (Loconte 115). But these anti-war sentiments did not stop Fosdick or other church leaders from ministering to those involved in the war effort. In fact, Riverside Church played a significant role in the lives of men and women who were training or stationed in New York during the war. 'A notice that ran in the bulletin of the Riverside Church throughout the war years welcomed any military personnel who were worshiping with the congregation, encouraged them to sign a guest register specially designed for them, and informed them of Dr. Fosdick's willingness to write a personal note to anyone they desired back home, informing that person of their visit to Riverside' (Paris et al. 120). I was particularly struck when wandering through the nave by this inscription thanking the church for its hospitality during the war: (Image Credit: Meredith Levin) I have a lot of research ahead of me, including visits to the Riverside Church Archives and to the Special Collections at the Union Theological Seminary's Burke Library but I am excited at the prospect of uncovering more about art, education, and wartime solidarity at Riverside Church.

    "content": " I have never felt at home in the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine. To me it has always seemed needlessly massive, incoherent, uninspired, and, perhaps worst of all, uninspiring. The questions I am inclined to contemplate when there are not eternal but rather historical ones, such as: How did this Church come to be what it is? Thus, when we were asked to choose a building to research for our Morningside history project, I naturally chose this one. I went on a wonderfully instructive tour of the Church today (“Within the Walls: Exploring Hidden Spaces”). We went up spiral staircases at both the eastern and western ends of the Church and down into the crypt, which had been the first space of worship inside of the Church. I had just read Andrew Dolkart’s treatment of this Church in his Morningside Heights book, so I was especially attentive to questions of architectural history. Where did the work of the original architectural team, Heins and La Farge, leave off? And where did the work of the architect Ralph Adams Cram (who was appointed after the death of Heins and the dismissal of La Farge) begin? Those questions are rooted in my initial offhand impression that the Church is an incoherent space, an impression that turns out to be amply justified by its history. Heins and La Farge had designed and begun building a Romanesque interior. Cram’s plan was Gothic inside and out; although he was thoughtful enough to blend the two styles a bit in the east-end dome behind the Romanesque arch that Heins and La Farge had built.  My overall impression is that Heins and La Farge were men of genius, whereas Cram was merely a talented craftsman with a strong belief in the supremacy of the Gothic style. My views of these architects’ accomplishments are no doubt influenced by my bias in favor of a Romanesque style for modern church architecture. The true Gothic style was a vigorous and authentic expression of Medieval spirituality; but the Gothic Revival style of the 19th-20th centuries is another thing entirely. As John Henry Newman put it: “[Gothic] was once the perfect expression of the Church’s ritual in those places in which it was in use; it is not the perfect expression now.”  (Quoted in Michael Hall, “What Do Victorian Churches Mean? Symbolism and Sacramentalism in Anglican Church Architecture, 1850-1870,” Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, Vol. 59, No. 1  (Mar., 2000), p. 80). Now, when I go to the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, I am no longer overwhelmed by a feeling of incoherence. I walk to the east--where the sun rises, where some of the Romanesque work of Heins and La Farge can still be seen, and where the intricate tile vaulting work of Guastavino is most plainly visible. I pass through the long Gothic nave, and find myself in the dim, unfinished crossing, with its rough-hewn beauty and great rounded dome, or in the ambulatory behind the main altar, with its richly decorated floors and ceilings. Here, at the Church’s east end, I can see inspiration. I feel at home and think of the church that might have been. ",

GitHub is a hosting service that lives in the cloud. 2. A repository is a set of files and directories; an historical record of changes; a set of committed objects. One might think of it as a folder being tracked by a system. At any point that you visit the repository you will be able to view a history of the changes because they have been being tracked automatically. 3. One gives a name to each entity that is committed to the repository. Once you have a sequence of named entities you can roll back to any earlier named entity. Since the rollback feature was not working properly I don't have a detailed hands-on sense of how this works. 4. It is possible to clone a repository from another user. When that user has identified you as someone who is permitted to clone, then you will have ability to edit repository. Other users will be able to access the repository on a view only basis.

    "content": " 1. Team updates The Design team has been working on a front page for our public site. It will be handed over to the Development Team for implementation once the design work is completed. Karen Green, Chair of Design Team, showed the group a Power Point mock-up of the intended wire frame. The overall design in progress was well received. The major question raised concerned the color palette for the historic map. This had been altered to conform with logo and other page colors. The suggestion was made that the Design Team consider returning to the original color palette of the map and draw a key color from that for use in the color scheme of the logo. 2. Common thread in exhibits We are all in agreement that the foundational phase of each contributor''s chosen site or institution will be somehow covered or accounted for in each exhibit. Each exhibit can go on to focus on other aspects of the site or institution, as appropriate, but the foundational phase needs to be covered, since the site is about Morningside history and the development of the neighborhood. The date span covered by exhibits on the site will range from 1821 (for the earliest building, Bloomingdale Asylum) to 1950; but this does not mean that the site as a whole will provide an account of Morningside history for that entire time range. Each contributor will choose a meaningful time span to cover for her/his chosen site or institution. 3.Timeline to Initial Launch It was agreed that launch date for public site should be extended to Monday, February 2, 2015. This is because Courseworks research guides need to be recreated in the LibGuides program by mid January. ___ACTION ITEM:___ Each team member should block off on his/her calendar two full days to devote to his/her exhibit in January before Spring Semester begins. 4. Meeting schedule after public launch of site Should we modify meeting schedule after initial launch? It was agreed that for now we should leave the schedule as is. After initial launch, we should move on to phase two and focus on learning new skills that would enable us to add new aspects or dimensions to the site, for example, Neatline. We will involve our new Humanities Research Librarian and our new Spring Semester Intern in phase two of the site. ___ACTION ITEM:___ Each team member should send Barbara a list of skills they would like to learn that would be relevant to a phase two of the MHDH site. 5. Questions regarding exhibits. An open forum. The requirement that the eight required items supporting each exhibit be open access is presenting a quandary. We are in agreement that printed items published prior to 1923 can, under most ordinary circumstances, be scanned, uploaded, and made available openly online. But what about items from that timeframe that we access in microfilm? What about items from that timeframe that have been made available by vendors in PDF format in commercial databases? A dialogue regarding this latter question has already been initiated with one of our vendors by Bob Scott. One of our exhibits, furthermore, would require the use of materials from outside of the pre-1923 timeframe--since it focuses on Riverside Church, which was built in 1930. Rina Pantalony, the new Director the the Copyright Advisory Office will meet with us at the start of our next H&H meeting. Barbara will email to her our questions in advance so we can hear what she advises. ",

The default file folder for our new project put it into the Git folder. This is bad practice. It is better to keep your project folders separate from the software folder. We created a www folders on the c drive and put our project folders there. 3. Some of us had already clicked 'create' to save the projects in the git folder, so Alex showed us how to delete a project on the Github site. It really is called the 'Danger Zone'. I thought he was joking! 4. We created a new index.html file in Notepad ++, and added some text.  Those of us who created our new file in regular Notepad created folders called: index.html.txt. This was corrected by deleting the file, recreating, and then moving it into the project folder. We admired our new project folders in Git on our computers, and reviewed our changes, but when it came time to commit my changes to Git hub, synching failed.

    "content": " In our meeting today we basically focused on two things: the work of our Research and Editorial Team and how to keep this Developing Librarian blog vital and varied--reflective of the vital and varied nature of our own experiences working on this project. Our Research and Editorial Team consists of Mary Cargill and Elizabeth Davis. They shared with the group a preliminary list of sources for Morningside Heights history.  The question arose of how this team's work on metadata will be coordinated with the work of other teams and individuals. It was agreed that they will wait until people start posting more items to the project site to assess the metadata issues that are arising. It was further agreed that people should make use of the Library of Congress Authorities file: [http://authorities.loc.gov/](http://authorities.loc.gov/) wherever that file provides a name for a building or other site on which they are working. Bob suggested that there are many kinds of documents that have overarching significance for Morningside Heights: for example, manuscript census records. He will work with the Research and Editorial team to get some of these types of documents incorporated into our site. This blog has gone through some lull periods and has lately become more active again now that the group has been gathered into teams. We would like it to become more consistently active, however. We agreed on a plan in which each of our four teams in weekly rotation would be asked to do a posting. (Those teams are: Design; Research and Editorial; Project Management; and Development.)  Blog entries are about process and they don't need to be long. The Design Team will have two logo designs ready to show the group at our June 3 meeting. They have been learning Illustrator, which is very different from Photoshop. The Development Team continues to work on Git. And Project Management continues to plan our agendas. ",

    "content": " Our project is moving forward along two basic tracks. The first is team accomplishments, and progress here depends heavily on synchronization. For example, the Design Team needed to complete its designs and specifications for logo and home page before the Development Team could begin working on implementing them. The second track is individual accomplishments. Each individual has chosen an historic Morninigside site, and is required to create three exhibit pages, each of which explores some aspect of it. Each of us is also charged with uploading twenty documentary items, some of which should be integrated into the exhibits, while others can simply enrich the scope of the site as a whole. Within the overall deadline of December 2014, when our project is slated to have its initial launch, the timing of individual accomplishments is quite flexible. Nevertheless, various group members have expressed the idea that further individual progress on items and/or exhibits would actually be helpful to give us all a greater sense of where the project is going. With this in mind, two open labs have been scheduled for this coming week in which individuals can work on any aspect of the project they choose. Bob Scott and Alex Gil will be on hand at the open labs to provide expert guidance as needed for matters such as the creation of bibliographies in Zotero and the uploading of documentary items to the project site. Near the beginning of the project, we all had training in both and we already have for each Morningside site an initial body of work to return to and expand upon. There is a lot of energy in the group right now, in these last weeks of summer; and we are all looking forward to the open labs. ",

    "content": " A scant six weeks after presenting our design choices to the Developing Library group, the Design and Development Teams at last sat down together to hammer out the details for which each were dependent on the other. The Design Team learned that the Development Team had chosen the Omeka theme 'Berlin', which we found...unappealing. The Development Team assured us that the choice was based on functionality, not style, as almost all stylistic elements in the theme could be adapted, which we found very reassuring. We were tasked with nailing down the color scheme, font, and main page design. Our earlier color scheme of charcoal grey background, with red and yellow accents, as found at the Jan Breughel Wiki page, had been questioned by the Development Team, given the difficulty, on text-heavy pages, of reading light text on a dark background. We agreed that that was a problem, but didn't find it an insurmountable problem. The Brueghel Wiki deals with it by lightening the grey where there's a preponderance of text; we felt that we could even create a frame for the text that would allow us to present it as black on white, within the framework of the charcoal grey background. So, for now, charcoal grey with red and yellow remains our color scheme, and we will be amending the logos to reflect that choice. Menu tabs at the top of the main map image remain our choice, as well. We are still fans of the Medici Archive Project site, with its menu tabs above the main images. We are also fans of the Mapping Gothic France main page, with its prominent main image, its text box that can be minimized so as not to obscure that image, its hovertext, and its minimalist footer.  To our great delight, we discovered that the Mapping Gothic France site, which is a Columbia project, is on GitHub, allowing us to mine its source code. The big decision for the day was....FONT.  So much of a site's visual impact relies on the font!  We knew we wanted a serif font, one that looked old-fashioned, like 19th-century newstype.  We played around with filters on Google Fonts without success--until, appropriately enough, the team-member who sits on both Design AND Development discovered the font with which we all fell in love: Old Standard TT. We played with it in Google Fonts, typing the names of each of our topics to see how they looked in the font, and we remained excited.  This felt like a huge, huge step forward. The Design Team also has the responsibility of delivering a design for item pages, but the two teams agreed that this would best be done collaboratively, once the Development Team has started building the site based on the specs thus far. It felt like a good meeting! ",

    "content": " 1. Development Team Update The Development Team showed our group the new home page for our Morningside Heights Digital History project site. This new page incorporates an historical map for Morningside Heights with its original colors restored (and slightly heightened for emphasis and clarity). The page surrounding the map was also revised to be in a color scheme that complemented the map. These color scheme revisions originated in decisions made in our Design Team. The revised color scheme represents a departure from our earlier plan of determining a desired color scheme for home page and altering the map coloring to fit that scheme. 2. Transitioning to CUL Server, Current Status and Issues There were four outstanding questions which LDPD had addressed to our group. They needed to have these questions answered prior to transitioning our Project site onto a server administered by Columbia Libraries. We reached consensus for most of these questions. For example, we do want the project site cataloged. After considering the commitment involved in migrating the site again and again as needed, we agreed that we would: a.) keep it alive until a migration was needed and b.) make sure that it gets preserved as a frozen site. The Development Team was charged with discussing issues for which questions remained. 3. Summer Schedule Various options for a summer schedule were discussed. It was decided, however, to table this discussion until we have understood more about what will be involved in Phase 2 of project. Phase 1 of the project, the Morningside History website, is still slated to be launched in June 2015. 4. Phase 2 The group considered that substantial time and effort had been required for Phase 1 of The Developing Librarian--the construction of the Morningside History project site. For phase 2 we agreed that we would retain the emphasis on developing and enhancing digital skills but abandon the idea of all contributing to a single digital project. Instead, we will work on individual digital projects of our own choosing. We will still dedicate group time to labs and meetings and we will educate one another about our projects. ___Action item:___ Each member should send a description of his or her individual Phase 2 project to Barbara. The Developing Librarian blog will still be actively maintained to chart our progress in Phase 2. 5. Friday open labs Barbara has sent out invitations to the group for a series of Friday open labs in May and early June. These are optional lab sessions in which group members can work together in finishing up work needed to be done prior to project site launch in June. ",

Except for contemplating the vast and seemingly complicated subway system, I never considered what was below my feet and how the natural environment has helped shape the city. In the 600 block of 114th Street, between Broadway and Riverside Drive, curiously behind a tall fence, sits a large rock. Sandwiched between two turn-of-the-century buildings, the boulder's dark color makes it impossible not to notice. This is Rat Rock. The rock is actually schist, a common, durable rock type that can be found all over the island (above and below ground), particularly in lower and northern Manhattan. Its prevalence on the island is the reason it is often referred to as Manhattan schist. Rat Rock, named for its desirable nesting possibilities for rodents, is just one of the distinctive characteristics of the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. With Riverside Park, Morningside Park, and proximity to Central Park, nature and the environment are ever present. Morningside Heights is actually a rocky plateau, providing a completely natural distinction and isolation from the busy city we're familiar with. My research for the Morningside Heights project will focus on how the land of the neighborhood has changed from 1820 through 1950. Using Rat Rock as a jumping off point, I will use archival materials, historic newspapers, maps, and drawings to illustrate the transformation of the area. View Larger Map ",

This included a discussion of the Dublin Core fields that need to be filled out when an item is added to site. It is clear that there are conceptual issues involved in the designation of 'item type' and other fields that Dublin Core requires. We will need to be thinking and talking about issues arising here, looking closely at Dublin Core definitions, thinking about subject tags, and agreeing on standards as we work.
