Our project is moving forward along two basic tracks. The first is team
  accomplishments, and progress here depends heavily on synchronization. For example,
  the Design Team needed to complete its designs and specifications for logo and home
  page before the Development Team could begin working on implementing them. The second
  track is individual accomplishments. Each individual has chosen an historic Morninigside
  site, and is required to create three exhibit pages, each of which explores some
  aspect of it. Each of us is also charged with uploading twenty documentary items,
  some of which should be integrated into the exhibits, while others can simply enrich
  the scope of the site as a whole. Within the overall deadline of December 2014,
  when our project is slated to have its initial launch, the timing of individual
  accomplishments is quite flexible.

Nevertheless, various group members have expressed
  the idea that further individual progress on items and/or exhibits would actually
  be helpful to give us all a greater sense of where the project is going. With this
  in mind, two open labs have been scheduled for this coming week in which individuals
  can work on any aspect of the project they choose. Bob Scott and Alex Gil will be
  on hand at the open labs to provide expert guidance as needed for matters such as
  the creation of bibliographies in Zotero and the uploading of documentary items
  to the project site. Near the beginning of the project, we all had training in both
  and we already have for each Morningside site an initial body of work to return
  to and expand upon. There is a lot of energy in the group right now, in these last
  weeks of summer; and we are all looking forward to the open labs.
