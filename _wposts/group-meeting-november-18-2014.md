The main focus of today's meeting was on exhibits.

__1. What is an exhibit?__

And what do I need to do to create one? An exhibit is an essay or narrative illustrated
  by online items that support or enrich what is being said. There is no prescribed
  length. It should be as long as it needs to be to tell the story you want to tell.
  We should assume that our audience has no knowledge of the topic of our exhibit.

Meredith showed the group how exhibits and specific exhibit pages can be created
  using straightforward options at our Omeka site. For each page in your exhibit you
  can choose from a variety of layout choices.

The Design Team will be communicating
  with the Development Team regarding basic visual appearance options such as color
  and font. While those appearance options will alter the appearance of our exhibits,
  they will not alter our content or layout choices. Each individual should begin,
  as soon as she or he is ready, to create exhibits and exhibit pages, choose layouts,
  and add content.

__2. Timeline and requirements__

The team decided to extend the initial
  launch deadline for the public site to January 21, thus taking advantage of the
  lull time of Winter break to get work completed. Each exhibit should have a minimum
  of eight items integrated into it. People are free to add more items if they wish--either
  to their exhibits or to our public site in general, where all items will be browsable
  as items.

__3. Example of an exhibit__

John discussed with the group an exhibit he had
  created for his chosen Morningside location--Cathedral Church of Saint John the
  Divine. He chose to focus on the competing visions of the architects who worked
  on the cathedral. Due to time constraints he limited archival research to Avery
  Drawings. For this building, he felt that there was enough non-archival material
  available to tell the story he wanted to tell. One key resource of interest for
  most of our locations is the database "American Periodicals (1740-1940)." This
  includes a good selection of architectural periodicals for 19th and 20th centuries.
