In our Developing Librarian Meeting today we moved forward in various ways.
<ul>
  <li><p>The Project Management team (Nancy and John) presented to the group
  a new central Google-shared space containing a folder for each team, foundational
  project documents, and our project timeline. Teams were invited to deposit in their
  folders any documents that they wished to share with the group as a whole.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Development Team reported that they were ahead of projected deadline for
  creating and sharing amongst themselves a GitHub repository. Meredith and Alex explained
  more to the group about the importance of GitHub. It allows the Development Team
  to stay synchronized with one another in making design changes, sharing data, and
  posting content. So far there is a Master branch and a Design branch. There can
  be any number of branches. An important principle in GitHub is that any branch other
  than the Master branch might get broken but the integrity of accomplished work will
  be preserved as long as the Master branch remains intact.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Development Team is using GitHub to work on the scaffolding or platform for our Morningside
  project site. We have so far been individually contributing various items with various
  content fields concerning buildings or places in Morningside Heights. The platform
  designed in GitHub will determine how users interact with those items, how they
  are presented, etc.</p></li>

  <li><p>Individuals were invited to continue adding items as
  appropriate to our old bare-bones project site. All of these will finally be absorbed
  into the platform currently under design.</p></li>

  <li><p>The Design Team has two logos under consideration. These two, with variants, will be presented to the group as
  a whole by late May.</p></li>

  <li><p>It was decided that any instruction being provided
  to any team should be announced in advance to the group as a whole, so that anyone
  who wished to could participate. For example, Alex was scheduled to meet with the
  Design Team after this morning's meeting in order to instruct them in how to use
  the program Illustrator for design of logos. Other group members decided to join
  in this instructional session in order to learn Illustrator basics.</p></li>
</ul>
