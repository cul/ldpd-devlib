John, Junko, and I have met to work on the theme design. We chose a theme called Weaver II, which has a narrow header image that won't clog up a screen and hide the posts.

We changed the header to a cropped image of Plimpton Cuneiform 322, from our own RBML. More info <a href='http://www.columbia.edu/cu/lweb/eresources/exhibitions/treasures/html/long_topic9.html' title='cuneiform'>here</a>. John in particular liked this portion of the image because it has a BREAK, as in 'breaking the code.'

We weren't able to change the color of the background, but we thought it went well with the browns of the cuneiform. Hope you agree! Tell us in the comments!
