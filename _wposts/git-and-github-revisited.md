<p>1. The difference between Git and GitHub is as follows: Git is a tool
  to manage your source code history. It lives in your computer. GitHub is a hosting
  service that lives in the cloud.</p>
<p>2. A repository is a set of files and directories;
  an historical record of changes; a set of committed objects. One might think of
  it as a folder being tracked by a system. At any point that you visit the repository
  you will be able to view a history of the changes because they have been being tracked
  automatically.</p>
<p>3. One gives a name to each entity that is committed to the repository.
  Once you have a sequence of named entities you can roll back to any earlier named
  entity. Since the rollback feature was not working properly I don't have a detailed
  hands-on sense of how this works.</p>
<p>4. It is possible to clone a repository from another
  user. When that user has identified you as someone who is permitted to clone, then
  you will have ability to edit repository. Other users will be able to access the
  repository on a view only basis. I still lack a hands-on sense of how to clone.</p>
