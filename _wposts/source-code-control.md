From our meeting with Breck on 9/17/13 I took away these four things:

1. Source code control is external to our site. We will use Git to allow collaboration on code and to keep track of changes. This also enables versioning and being able to roll back changes. LITO is more comfortable with our group creating code if it's in a repository with dev, test, and prod aspects.

2. The dev/test/prod relationship is essential in the process of creating a website. We should all be looking at the test version. We will be using dev/test/prod on a VM, virtual machine.

3. Our site needs to be monitored. Someone should be responsible for checking that it's functioning properly and has not been hacked or tampered with.

4. Service level agreements, SLAs, are important arrangements with technology providers. Some issues to arrange: tech support; maintenance of site; security protocols; data backup; encryption; performance requirements.
