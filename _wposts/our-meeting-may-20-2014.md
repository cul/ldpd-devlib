In our meeting today we basically focused on two things: the work of
  our Research and Editorial Team and how to keep this Developing Librarian blog vital
  and varied--reflective of the vital and varied nature of our own experiences working
  on this project.

Our Research and Editorial Team consists of Mary Cargill and Elizabeth
  Davis. They shared with the group a preliminary list of sources for Morningside
  Heights history.  The question arose of how this team's work on metadata will be
  coordinated with the work of other teams and individuals. It was agreed that they
  will wait until people start posting more items to the project site to assess the
  metadata issues that are arising. It was further agreed that people should make
  use of the Library of Congress Authorities file: [http://authorities.loc.gov/](http://authorities.loc.gov/) wherever
  that file provides a name for a building or other site on which they are working.
  Bob suggested that there are many kinds of documents that have overarching significance
  for Morningside Heights: for example, manuscript census records. He will work with
  the Research and Editorial team to get some of these types of documents incorporated
  into our site.

This blog has gone through some lull periods and has lately become
  more active again now that the group has been gathered into teams. We would like
  it to become more consistently active, however. We agreed on a plan in which each
  of our four teams in weekly rotation would be asked to do a posting. (Those teams
  are: Design; Research and Editorial; Project Management; and Development.)  Blog
  entries are about process and they don't need to be long.

The Design Team will have two logo designs ready to show the group at our June 3 meeting. They have been
  learning Illustrator, which is very different from Photoshop. The Development Team
  continues to work on Git. And Project Management continues to plan our agendas.
