Today's session on Git, though still frustrating due to glitches in the Windows program, helped clarify the application. Here are the four things I learned:

1. Github is an application - it's the tool to manage source code for each project. Github.com is the website which is a hosting service for the repositories.

2. Notepad++ is the text editor used for coding in Windows.

3. You can rollback to a previous commit in your repository - this is an extreme move and only used rarely.

4. Why are we here: to troubleshoot; and to learn how to learn.
