My hope for this project is that it will present us a hands-on, practical survey of many of the tools and techniques that might be involved in working on digital projects with our users. This could be anyone from an undergraduate seeking to incorporate media elements into their paper, to a graduate student perhaps working with digital tools and datasets in their research, to faculty developing a long-term digital project on the web. I also include librarians in our user group. There are many potential applications for us to use these tools to develop digital projects and services that can benefit our users.
