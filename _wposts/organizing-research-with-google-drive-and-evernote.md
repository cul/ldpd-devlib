For the past few weeks, I've been viewing archival materials at Columbia's <a title='Rare Book & Manuscript Library - Columbia University Libraries' href='http://library.columbia.edu/locations/rbml.html'>Rare Book & Manuscript Library (RBML)</a>. Two collections have played a significant role in my research: the <a title='Buildings & Grounds Collection finding aid - Columbia University Libraries' href='http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead/nnc-ua/ldpd_7201471'>Buildings & Grounds Collection (1755-2012)</a> and the <a title='Historical Photographs Collection finding aid - Columbia University Libraries' href='http://findingaids.cul.columbia.edu/ead//nnc-ua/ldpd_4080179'>Historical Photographs Collection (1855-2012)</a>. I found maps, letters, and photographs that all pertain to <a title='Rat Rock: A Look at the Landscape of Morningside Heights - Developing Library' href='http://www.developinglibrarian.org/rat-rock-a-look-at-the-landscape-of-morningside-heights/'>my research topic</a>.

I've been rethinking the way I collect digital resources during this project. As a student, I had a good understanding of my research strengths and weaknesses. The system I would devise for this project had to allow me to be mobile considering I would have to visit different libraries as well as keep all of my sources in one simple place. For precisely these reasons, I chose to <a title='Create a Google Form - Google.com' href='https://support.google.com/drive/answer/87809?hl=en'>create a form in Google Drive</a> that would aggregate all my source information to a spreadsheet. The form was created to record digital and analog resources that I discover during my preliminary search and would easily allow me to get back to those resources for further investigation.

The form took a bit of time to create and was based on the following questions:

- What am I looking for?
- What am I using to look for it? (Platform of source)
- How did I get here? (Search terms)
- What did I find? (Title of material, format, etc.)
- How did I retain the information? (File names, bookmarks, etc.)
- What is the copyright information for what I’ve found?
- How does this fit into my thesis?

The form is great for text but does not work for images (reference photographs) of primary sources. For this part of my research, I have turned to <a title='Evernote' href='https://evernote.com/' >Evernote</a>. With Evernote, you can write simple text notes, add photographs to notes, record audio, and more. Each note can be easily organized within a notebook and notebooks can be organized within 'stacks.' Evernote and the Google form relate in a parent/child relationship. The basic collection information is recorded via the Google form (with a note about whether or not the collection was actually viewed) and Evernote is used to capture individual items within that collection.

I struggled with how to organize reference photographs of documents I need to evaluate for future possible digitization. In
  the past I've used the camera on my phone, which leads to wasted time, chaos, and
  frustration because each of those snaps would have to be corralled somehow, not
  to mention the fact that all of my work related snaps would be mixed with photographs
  from my personal life. Before heading over to RBML, I decided to take reference
  photos using my iPad.

One of the best aspects of Evernote is that you can install it on your computer, use it as a web application, and download it on your mobile
  device.  There are lots of applications that can sync to your Evernote account to
  make it more efficient based on your needs. I'm curious to hear how others use
  Evernote so that I enhance my own experience. I have a feeling I haven't discovered
  all it has to offer quite yet.
