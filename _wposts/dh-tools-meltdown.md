Today our project was to create a repository in Git, to store on the GitHub.Â It was a bit of a bumpy ride. What did I learn today?

<p>
  1. Mac Git and Windows Git are very, very different.<br/>
  2. It can be difficult for even the most well-informed and patient instructor to wrangle a large group of people with differing levels of tech-savviness.<br/>
  3. the difference between CamelScript and snake_script (the latter
    made me think of <em>scriptura continua</em>)<br/>
  4. Why we installed Notepad++ (e.g. so that, instead of as in regular Notepad, we can create HTML files that aren't automatically saved as TXT files)
</p>

Bonus thing: if you're afraid of commitment, Git is not for you.
