New things:

1. I learned about using snake (jj_jjj) and camel font (jjJj) for naming.

2. The importance of creating a WWW folder for web project content.

3. Git is useful for tracking changes and creating a history of changes. We will
  be working in a virtual space on our local computers - content will get uploaded
  (committed) to Git and then to server. It is important for us to create a dev and
  staging space on server for our web project development.

4. Commit often!
