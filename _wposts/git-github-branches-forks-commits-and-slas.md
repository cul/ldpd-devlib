<ul>
  <li><p>This morning we had an introduction to Git and to source and version control. Git is open source software that will allow us to preserve and work on our code in a distributed environment.</p></li>
  <li><p>This afternoon Stuart Marquis discussed Git and Github in CLIO development. He showed how each JIRA ticket from
  the CLIO development project becomes a commit in Git, and how we are using Git to
  track version changes and for our release notes.</p></li>
</ul>

Two other things I learned:

<ul>
  <li><p>The importance of having three versions of our project: a production version,
  a development version, and a test version. We work in the development instance
  and then push changes to test, and from test to production.</p></li>
  <li><p>Service Level Agreements define service level expectations and can spell out the consequences
  of not meeting the agreement.Â This is important when working with vendors, but
  it is also important as we work more closely with faculty and others on digital
  projects or services. These could help us define what we can be expected to offer.</p></li>
</ul>
