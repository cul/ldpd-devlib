<strong>1. Development Team Update</strong>

The Development Team showed our group the new home page for our Morningside Heights Digital History project
  site. This new page incorporates an historical map for Morningside Heights with
  its original colors restored (and slightly heightened for emphasis and clarity).
  The page surrounding the map was also revised to be in a color scheme that complemented
  the map. These color scheme revisions originated in decisions made in our Design
  Team. The revised color scheme represents a departure from our earlier plan of determining
  a desired color scheme for home page and altering the map coloring to fit that scheme.


<strong>2. Transitioning to CUL Server, Current Status and Issues</strong>

There were four outstanding questions which LDPD had addressed to our group. They needed
  to have these questions answered prior to transitioning our Project site onto a
  server administered by Columbia Libraries. We reached consensus for most of these
  questions. For example, we do want the project site cataloged. After considering
  the commitment involved in migrating the site again and again as needed, we agreed
  that we would: a.) keep it alive until a migration was needed and b.) make sure
  that it gets preserved as a frozen site. The Development Team was charged with discussing
  issues for which questions remained.

<strong>3. Summer Schedule</strong>
Various options for a summer schedule were discussed. It was decided, however, to table
  this discussion until we have understood more about what will be involved in Phase
  2 of project. Phase 1 of the project, the Morningside History website, is still
  slated to be launched in June 2015.

<strong>4. Phase 2</strong>

The group considered that substantial time and effort had been required for Phase 1 of The Developing
  Librarian--the construction of the Morningside History project site. For phase 2
  we agreed that we would retain the emphasis on developing and enhancing digital
  skills but abandon the idea of all contributing to a single digital project. Instead,
  we will work on individual digital projects of our own choosing. We will still dedicate
  group time to labs and meetings and we will educate one another about our projects.

___Action item:___ Each member should send a description of his or her individual Phase
  2 project to Barbara. The Developing Librarian blog will still be actively maintained
  to chart our progress in Phase 2.

<strong>5. Friday open labs</strong>

Barbara has sent out invitations to the group for a series of Friday open labs in May and early
  June. These are optional lab sessions in which group members can work together in
  finishing up work needed to be done prior to project site launch in June.
