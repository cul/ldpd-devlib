I found this tool in Bamboo DiRT under the category Communicate with Colleagues. <strong>Piazza</strong> is an open-source web-based discussion tool that works like a chat room. Here's the link: <a href='https://piazza.com/'>https://piazza.com/</a>

It's promoted as a more efficient way to engage in classroom Q&A but I can also see its value in managing the communication of any group that is working together and engaged in dialog. One big advantage over a Course Management System is that users can post anonymously to the discussion and there is less hierarchy than in a CMS. Here's an article about it in <a href='http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/using-piazza-to-encourage-interaction/39317'>The Chronicle of Higher Education.</a>

Some potential uses:
- a way for all UW students in a semester to communicate with librarians and ask questions, and also with other UW students in different sections.
- a way to bypass the email overload that is the inevitable result of a group discussion related to a specific project. I could see how this might have been helpful in our group work on the Self-Study Assessment.
