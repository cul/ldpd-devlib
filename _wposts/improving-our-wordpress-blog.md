Tuesday's session was primarily about how to deal with a specific
  issue in our developing librarian blog.  We decided that we would like to share
  our "four things" among ourselves (and with anyone else who is interested), but
  we didn't want to overwhelm the blog with repetitive content. Bob and John and Alex discussed the steps they followed to identify and implement category to page
  functionality. Things I learned:

<p>1. Category to Page. The existence of this feature was an eye opener. I could think of so many possible uses for this on <a href="https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/cliobeta/">CLIO News</a>, which we are using for CLIO support.  Right now we use pages for our search tips, and the main blog for general announcements. Category to page would allow us to add content to pages, and still have it go out to RSS subscribers.</p>

<p>2. How to add pages, menus, and sub-menus, and re-arrange the
  menus.  This is pretty basic, but will also be very useful for the CLIO and possibly
  <a href="https://blogs.cul.columbia.edu/butler/">Butler</a> blogs.</p>

<p>3. It was great to see how Alex edited the retina child page to create the
  special layout on "four things" page. I'm excited to try PHP. It is wonderful
  to have the freedom to experiment with the Developing Librarian page.  Our library
  blogs are administered centrally, so I don't know how much freedom there is to
  experiment with plug ins and other features, but now that I've seen some of the
  possibilities, I can at least think about how to request additional functionality,
  if needed.</p>

<p>4. PHP was originally an acronym for "Personal Home Page."  Now (according
  to wikipedia)  it is called "PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor" which is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_acronym">recursive acronym</a>.</p>
