1. Announcements and updates Bob Scott announced that he, Meredith,
  Sarah, and Alex have had a proposal approved for the Digital Library Federation
  Forum in Atlanta this October. They will be doing a presentation on our Developing
  Librarian project.

2. Design team report Karen Green reported on the latest progress
  of the Design Team, of which she is chair. The specifications decided on by the
  Design Team, regarding logos, homepage design, etc., are being turned over to the
  Development Team for further work. For a full report on the Design Team's progress,
  see Karen's August 15 posting <a href="http://wp.me/p39qNh-jn">"Design
  Team Update.."</a>

3. Redistributing Project Responsibilities One of our colleagues,
  Mary Cargill, will be retiring in October. She was one of the originators of the
  Morningside history project idea, and her expertise has enriched the historical
  awareness of the group from the beginning. She is a member of the Research and Editorial
  Team and had been researching the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum as her individual
  project component. We have agreed on the following adjustments in order to keep
  the project on track.

  a. "Fact checking" will be removed from the responsibilities
  assigned to the Research and Editorial Team in our project agenda and time line.
  "Metadata standards" will be retained as the team's key responsibility. Beginning
  in October, this team will simply be the Editorial Team. Each librarian creating
  exhibits will be responsible for maintaining and verifying the historical accuracy
  of his or her own exhibits. Since only one person is now left on the Editorial Team,
  we will need to be open to reassessing this workflow and providing further assistance
  as needed. b. The last research task of the Research and Editorial team before it
  shifts into Editorial mode will be a bibliography of selected key general sources
  relevant to the history of Morningside Heights. The deadline for this bibliography
  is September 30, 2014. c. Karen Green, who had earlier been focusing on the Lion
  Brewery, agreed to focus her exhibits on the Leake and Watts Orphan Asylum instead.
  4. Open labs and instructional sessions The next two regularly scheduled meetings
  of the Developing Librarian group will be instructional sessions: 8/26 will be a
  Zotero session led by Bob Scott; 9/9 will be a session on uploading items to the
  project site, led by Alex Gil. Two open labs, at which people can work on whatever
  aspect of the project they wish, will be held during the week of 8/18-8/22.
