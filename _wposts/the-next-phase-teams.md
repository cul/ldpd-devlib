During our Developing Librarian session today we formed teams to move the project forward. We have been preparing for this since the project started. After 18 months of training sessions we are all ready to choose the team we are best suited for. We have four teams:

1. <strong>Design</strong> - typography, CSS (+version control), layout of Omeka site, user experience [Anice, Karen, Barbara]

2. <strong>Research and editorial</strong> - content creation, contextual information, fact checking, tracking resources, and consistency [Mary, Elizabeth]

3. <strong>Project Management</strong> - assessment, meeting deadlines, scheduling, PR, resolves conflicts, team work and liaise with external partners [John, Nancy]

4. <strong>Development</strong> - GitHub, basic PHP, back ups, version control, Neatline, data ingest, and managing servers [Bob, Meredith, Sarah, Nick, Alex]

The next phase begins, which is the experiential learning phase. We will continue to meet every two weeks, but our sessions will be team based and focused on the outcome of delivering the site. Outside of our bi-weekly meetings, the teams will also meet regularly and report back to the larger group.
