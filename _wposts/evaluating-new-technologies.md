As we move forward with our process in developing new skills, I am
  thinking about how best to evaluate new technologies. Advice suggests we shouldn't
  get overly enamored without first thinking about how that new technology applies
  to what we hope to achieve. Advice also suggests we need to test new technologies
  to see how well they do the job. I think this is interesting.Â  New technologies
  are developed at a fast rate -- and what is already available is overwhelming in
  numbers and scope. The way we do things is changing at a fast rate. I would like
  us to define criteria for evaluation or define reliable resources that can help
  us evaluate new tools and applications. We need to clearly understand what it is
  the student or faculty member is hoping to achieve -- in addition to advising and
  recommending traditional resources from our collections -- we are adding a new layer
  -- we need to understand the application. I really like the website Bamboo Dirt
  -- the main page offers "I need a digital research tool to...." -- I think this
  is a great approach. But when somebody wants to start blogging -- and the three
  main blogging tools out there -- Blogger, Wordpress and Tumblr -- it becomes a more
  detailed evaluation to decide which is going to work better. I just read somewhere
  that Google searches on Tumblr have now surpassed other blogs. Well, if having your
  site discoverable is of most importance -- then this might help decide to go with
  Tumblr.

Librarians are comfortable in this environment -- our service model has
  always focused on helping folks find what they need. It was reassuring to me to
  read the statement agreed upon by the American Association of University Professors
  stating that librarians continue to serve a vital role in helping faculty and students
  -- we advise and assist in scholarly pursuit. Forgive this rambling post -- stream
  of thought very early this morning.
