<p>1. For learning more about PHP, we should codecademy.com or Lynda.com.</p>
<p>2. PHP is a widely used open source scripting language.</p>
<p>3. PHP commands are typically incorporated into pages that begin and end as HTML documents.</p>
<p>4. The value and power of PHP is that it can execute instructions based on specified conditions. For example: increase the value of a variable at a certain rate; print out statements of increasing value of variable until it reaches a specific value; then stop. That is an example of a "While" statement. There are also "If" statements. HTML cannot execute conditional instructions.
