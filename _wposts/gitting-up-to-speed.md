Today we got our hands on Git. We'd already installed the software on our office desktops, but it wasn't installed on the 306 workstations, so we needed to download and install it on the DHC computers for our group session. Four things:

1. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case">snake_case</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase">CamelCase</a>. We used snake_case to name our Git projects.

2. The default file folder for our new project put it into the Git folder. This is bad practice. It is better to keep your project folders separate from the software folder. We created a www folders on the c drive and put our project folders there.

3. Some of us had already clicked "create" to save the projects in the git folder, so Alex showed us how to delete a project on the Github site. It really is called the "Danger Zone". I thought he was joking!

4. We created a new index.html file in Notepad ++, and added some text.  Those of us who created our new file in regular Notepad created folders called: index.html.txt. This was corrected by deleting the file, recreating, and then moving it into the project folder. We admired our new project folders in Git on our computers, and reviewed our changes, but when it came time to commit my changes to Git hub, synching failed. Question of the day:  Why did my synching fail?
