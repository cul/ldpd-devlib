Four things learned in today's session:

1. There is a difference between the Mac and Windows versions of Git which made our session slightly frustrating.

2. Right now our git only goes to Alex's server, not to the cloud. Eventually we'll have a virtual server on our workstations.

3. Git will keep track of all the versions- or commits- we make to our project. We should "commit often."

4. We all created our first repository on Git and created an index.html file. There were some glitches
  when we tried to sync this file to github.
