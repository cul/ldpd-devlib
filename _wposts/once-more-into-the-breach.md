Things have been a little quiet on the Developing Librarian front in
  the past few weeks, as we plunged into our heavy research skills instruction season. 
  But activity is beginning to stir once more...

We have split into teams and devised a timeline--not for THIS site but for the site that will eventually be the public
  face of the Morningside Heights project: i.e., the end product of all this training. 
  The teams are Project Management, Design, Development, and Research.  Each team
  has a leader: I'm the leader of the Design Team. Our mission: design the logo,
  header and footer; layout the homepage and any auxiliary pages; choose fonts and
  color schemes; create the credits.

At our first meeting, team members focused on
  logo design.  What is going to be the essential image that represents the project? 
  We brainstormed ideas; one of our members had a folder of reference logos for us
  to think about--will it go across the top? Down the side? Incorporate an iconographic
  element that instantly encapsulates the endeavor?

We agreed each to go off and develop
  one idea we liked, on paper.  On April 10th, we'll meet and compare the ideas;
  then we'll vote and choose the one we like best. Once the winning design emerges,
  we have scheduled an Adobe Illustrator training session for April 17, in order to
  devise as many variations on the winning design as possible. We'll then present
  these variants on a theme to the entire group: do we want the fonts compacted or
  elongated? Do we want the design components in heavy or light outline? Do we want
  the site title on one line or two?

The deadline for that presentation is our April
  29th meeting.  The group as a whole will vote on the winning variant--and then we'll
  have our logo.  The logo design, to a certain extent, drives the design of the header
  and footer, which is also due on April 29th.

So...check back with us at the end
  of the month--perhaps we'll reveal the winning design! Or...perhaps we'll wait
  until we can debut the entire site.  It will be a group decision: we're very democratic!
