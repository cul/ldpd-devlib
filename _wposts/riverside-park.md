I am investigating the development of Riverside Park and its landscape architect, Frederick Law Olmsted. I’ll be looking at Riverside Park in the vicinity of Morningside Heights, so from approximately 110<sup>th</sup> St. to 125<sup>th</sup> St. This area includes Grant’s Tomb and the Amiable Child Monument, both of which are possible topics of investigation.

This parcel of land next to the Hudson River was undeveloped until the construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1846, which was built to connect New York City to Albany. Construction of the park began in 1872.

Frederick Law Olmsted, celebrated landscape architect of Central Park, was instrumental in planning Riverside Park, and my research will include Olmsted’s writings and drawings. I would also like to include the social history of the park – the demographics of the neighborhood and how the park was used. My project will incorporate maps and a timeline.
