Following each of our training sessions we have individually submitted a list of four things we learned during the session. The reason we do this is because each training session has a list of learning objectives that we hope will be achieved. By compiling a list things we learned and mapping that list to the learning objectives, we are able to gauge the effectiveness of the training session. This immediate feedback after each unit also helps with the design of future units. As an experiment let's submit our four things as a blog post. This way we can see what others learned as well.

Here are my four things from this morning's session:

<p>1. The library has created a data dictionary for Omeka sites.<br/>
2. Using a spreadsheet for collecting metadata, rather than entering right into Omeka, enables the re-use of that data in our institutional repository.<br/>
3. The Image Lab will create high quality digital images for library staff of objects from our collections.<br/>
4. We are hoping to upgrade to Omeka 2.0 this summer and integrate Neatline.</p>
