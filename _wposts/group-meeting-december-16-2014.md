<strong>1. Team updates</strong>

The Design team has been working on a front page for our public site. It will be handed over to the Development Team for implementation once the design work is completed. Karen Green, Chair of Design Team, showed the group a Power Point mock-up of the intended wire frame. The overall
  design in progress was well received. The major question raised concerned the color
  palette for the historic map. This had been altered to conform with logo and other
  page colors. The suggestion was made that the Design Team consider returning to
  the original color palette of the map and draw a key color from that for use in
  the color scheme of the logo.

<strong>2. Common thread in exhibits</strong>

We are all in agreement that the foundational phase of each contributor''s chosen site
  or institution will be somehow covered or accounted for in each exhibit. Each exhibit
  can go on to focus on other aspects of the site or institution, as appropriate,
  but the foundational phase needs to be covered, since the site is about Morningside
  history and the development of the neighborhood. The date span covered by exhibits
  on the site will range from 1821 (for the earliest building, Bloomingdale Asylum)
  to 1950; but this does not mean that the site as a whole will provide an account
  of Morningside history for that entire time range. Each contributor will choose
  a meaningful time span to cover for her/his chosen site or institution.

<strong>3.Timeline to Initial Launch</strong>

It was agreed that launch date for public site should be extended to Monday, February 2, 2015. This is because Courseworks research guides need to be recreated in the LibGuides program by mid January.

___ACTION ITEM:___ Each team member should block off on his/her calendar two full days to devote to
  his/her exhibit in January before Spring Semester begins.

<strong>4. Meeting schedule after public launch of site</strong>

Should we modify meeting schedule after initial launch? It was agreed that for now we should leave the schedule as is. After initial launch, we should move on to phase two and focus on learning new skills that would
  enable us to add new aspects or dimensions to the site, for example, Neatline. We
  will involve our new Humanities Research Librarian and our new Spring Semester Intern
  in phase two of the site.

___ACTION ITEM:___ Each team member should send Barbara a list of skills they would like to learn that would be relevant to a phase two of the MHDH site.

<strong>5. Questions regarding exhibits. An open forum.</strong>

The requirement that the eight required items supporting each exhibit be open access
  is presenting a quandary. We are in agreement that printed items published prior
  to 1923 can, under most ordinary circumstances, be scanned, uploaded, and made available
  openly online. But what about items from that timeframe that we access in microfilm?
  What about items from that timeframe that have been made available by vendors in
  PDF format in commercial databases? A dialogue regarding this latter question has
  already been initiated with one of our vendors by Bob Scott. One of our exhibits,
  furthermore, would require the use of materials from outside of the pre-1923 timeframe--since
  it focuses on Riverside Church, which was built in 1930. Rina Pantalony, the new
  Director the the Copyright Advisory Office will meet with us at the start of our
  next H&H meeting. Barbara will email to her our questions in advance so we can hear
  what she advises.
