Four things from today's session on PHP:

1. PHP runs on the server to generate webpages; Javascript runs on the browser to animate your webpage.
2. Functions are the most common way to organize code; can be built-in or user-defined.
3. Functions can be named and then executed when called.
4. Syntax: echo means print; strings are text and are indicated by quotation marks; semi-colons separate statements.
