This Sunday, I took the first of what will probably be many tours of
  the Riverside Church. I've been trying to think about what my three exhibits will
  be and it has been difficult to decide what to focus on since so many aspects of
  the church's history are rich and fascinating. John D. Rockefeller's money and
  vision, Harry Emerson Fosdick's controversial ecumenical beliefs, and the architects'
  Gothic design hiding a modern steel framework all deserve extensive treatment. Because
  these have already been well-documented (in Dolkart and elsewhere), I'm leaning
  instead toward focusing on the details that most interest me: its visual culture,
  including stained glass windows, paintings, and sculptures, especially the impressive
  chancel screen and building facade; the evolution of its Weekday School for young
  children; and its role in the community during World War II.

<strong>Visual Culture at Riverside Church </strong>

The beauty of the building is undeniable. But what I find so charming about the Riverside Church is the mixture of Old and New World
  elements, varying styles and themes. It is a Gothic cathedral with clerestory windows
  and a chancel labyrinth modeled on those in the cathedral in Chartres, France, but
  its Christ Chapel is built in the Romanesque style, after the 11th-century nave
  of St. Nazaire in Carcassonne. Much of the stained glass is contemporary, including
  one window that honors the workers who helped make the church a reality (sculptors,
  artisans, carpenters), although the narthex features two remarkable 16th-century
  Flemish windows illustrating events and parables in the life of Christ. The windows
  are believed to be from a church that had been threatened or destroyed during the
  French Revolution and were dug up in a field in Bruges in the 19th century!

<strong>The Weekday School </strong>

Established in 1930 by Florence Allen Whitney Fosdick, the wife of Riverside's first pastor, the Weekday
  School (formerly known as the Nursery-Kindergarten Weekday School) is one of the
  oldest and most successful early childhood education programs in New York City.
  Mrs. Fosdick was dedicated to serving the local population of Morningside Heights-
  upon her death in 1964, it was asked that in lieu of flowers contributions should
  be made to a fund in her name that would permanently support the school (Miller
  300). While the Weekday School's original purpose was to provide care and education
  for the young children (ages 2-6) of working women, it is now a prestigious, tuition-based
  program that can cost upwards of $20,000 a year. The school maintains its original
  nondenominational and multicultural approach to education but one wonders how Mrs.
  Fosdick would feel about today's elite private enterprise.

<strong>Riverside Church and World War II</strong>

Harry Emerson Fosdick served as the pastor of Riverside
  Church from 1930-1946, seeing his congregants through much of the Great Depression
  and World War II, despite his personal beliefs as a pacifist. In May 1935, Fosdick
  joined 250 ministers and rabbis who met at Riverside Church and recited a pledge
  that their religious beliefs could not be reconciled with war (Sittser 24). Fosdick
  often delivered anti-war sermons, and published his famous 'Keeping Christ Above
  the Strife' in January 1941 in response to <em>The Christian Century</em>'s question,
  'If America is drawn into war, can you, as a Christian participate in it or support
  it?' (Loconte 115). But these anti-war sentiments did not stop Fosdick or other
  church leaders from ministering to those involved in the war effort. In fact, Riverside
  Church played a significant role in the lives of men and women who were training
  or stationed in New York during the war. 'A notice that ran in the bulletin of
  the Riverside Church throughout the war years welcomed any military personnel who
  were worshiping with the congregation, encouraged them to sign a guest register
  specially designed for them, and informed them of Dr. Fosdick's willingness to
  write a personal note to anyone they desired back home, informing that person of
  their visit to Riverside' (Paris et al. 120). I was particularly struck when wandering
  through the nave by this inscription thanking the church for its hospitality during
  the war:

I have a lot of research ahead of me, including visits to the Riverside Church Archives
  and to the Special Collections at the Union Theological Seminary's Burke Library
  but I am excited at the prospect of uncovering more about art, education, and wartime
  solidarity at Riverside Church. More to come soon...
