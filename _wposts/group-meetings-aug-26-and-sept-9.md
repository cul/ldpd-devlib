Each of these meetings was a combination of instruction with hands
  on workshop. For 8/26 meeting Bob Scott instructed the group on some finer points
  of Zotero and worked with individuals on questions arising as they contributed bibliographic
  entries to folders in our Group Library for the Morningside Project. For our 9/9
  meeting Alex Gil led a refresher session on posting items to our project site. This
  included a discussion of the Dublin Core fields that need to be filled out when
  an item is added to site. It is clear that there are conceptual issues involved
  in the designation of "item type" and other fields that Dublin Core requires.
  We will need to be thinking and talking about issues arising here, looking closely
  at Dublin Core definitions, thinking about subject tags, and agreeing on standards
  as we work. Both sessions included productive hands-on segments. In the first, group
  members expanded our library of bibliographic citations; and in the second we increased
  the number of items uploaded to our project site.
