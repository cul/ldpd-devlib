From our session today, 12/17/13, on web design principles:

1. The 3 elements of web design are: Layout; Typography; Color.

2. Non-overlapping vs. overlapping design refers to the imaginary boxes either not touching or bleeding into each other.

3. Responsive designÂ  - site adjusts to screen size.

4. CSS rules give instructions on print view, screen size.
