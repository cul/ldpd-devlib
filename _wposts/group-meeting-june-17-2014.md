The Design Team had done additional work on proposed logo designs for
  our Morningside History Project site. Two designs were presented to the group for
  a vote and one was chosen. Both designs demonstrated considerable ingenuity. One
  key consideration in logo selection was scalability. Would the key idea of logo
  remain clear in small, medium, and larger versions?

The Development Team reported on its progress. In a phase of initial enthusiasm, more than one team member would
  work on the same file in GitHub. They discovered, however, that this was not the
  best approach. Files in GitHub are not like documents in Google Docs, which can
  easily accommodate collaborative contributions. Multiple contributions to the same
  file from different users in GitHub actually creates conflicts. Older versions are
  not overwritten, but users are alerted to differences. The team decided it will
  take a more coordinated approach to files in GitHub, assigning responsibilities
  for specific files to specific individuals.

In the open forum phase of meeting, it was suggested that the group revisit the project time line. Corrections and clarifications
  were made there. A question arose around individual research for our Morningside
  History project. How do you determine the scope of your research and exhibits? The
  amount of potential information available regarding any given location, building,
  or individual can be daunting. All agreed to devote a significant portion of our
  next group meeting to discussing such questions. Barbara proposed as an assignment
  for each of us the simple topic definition exercise that some of us use for students
  of the University Writing Program:

I am researching __________________________ <br/>
because I want to find out ___________________________ <br/>
in order for my reader to understand ________________________________ .

In preparation for our next group meeting, on July 1, everyone should have completed this exercise.
