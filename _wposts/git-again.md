Things I learned from today's session.

Alex did a great job defining differences between Git and GitHub.<br/>
Git is the tool that manages the source code and history of changes.<br/>
GitHub is the service that hosts repositories -- it is the cloud.<br/>
Notepad++ is a good text editor for Windows and Alex recommends Textwrangler for Macs.<br/>
Good practice involves naming each commit as it is important to track changes and understand why you made the changes.
