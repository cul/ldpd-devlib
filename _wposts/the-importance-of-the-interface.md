A follow-up comment on our group discussion of the interesting article
  suggested by Bob, by Tanya Clement, 'Half-Baked: The State of Evaluation in the
  Digital Humanities' (<em>American Literary History</em>, Volume 24, Number 4, Winter
  2012, pp. 876-890; here's a <a href='http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/american_literary_history/v024/24.4.clement.html'>link
  via Project Muse</a>) - one point that was raised a couple times in passing was
  the importance of the <span style='text-decoration: underline;'>interface</span>
  (see for example p.881-882) - and this point resonates strongly for me.

Librarians have traditionally been concerned with the interface of users to information, of
  course, but this area seems to me to take on new dimensions in the digital sphere.
  We've all seen a parade of poorly-designed interfaces from vendors, and we, as
  expert users, know that they could do better. I suspect that we've also all seen
  flashy digital projects, that failed when the shortcomings of the user interface
  design became apparent. One theme seems to be that <em>we librarians are often the
  last people asked about effective interfaces</em> (if we're asked at all), whereas
  this is our natural turf, where we can shine.

I think part of our defining
  future roles in digital projects will be asserting our authority in this area, marketing
  what we have to offer as organizers of information; the challenge, and one of the
  good things about conducting a project such as ours, is to become knowledgeable
  enough to have the conversations on technology with our various project partners,
  so that we can take control of what's going on 'under the hood' of digital projects,
  and make sure that the information infrastructure is there to allow the fullest
  and most effective access to users.
