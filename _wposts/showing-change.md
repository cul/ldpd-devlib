I was curious to see how Omeka sites have illustrated population growth and other changes over time.  I was hoping to find something similar to the <a href='http://blog.pastmapper.com/about-pastmapper/'>Pastmapper</a> site about <a href='http://pastmapper.com/projects/greenwich_village/#'>Greenwich Village,</a> which takes a street in Greenwich village and incorporates census and building data.  It is not an Omeka site, but I very much like the way it works. I'd love to do something similar for a block in Morningside Heights.

I looked for Omeka sites that incorporate census data.  In <a href='http://www.digitalamherst.org'>Digital Amherst</a>, <a href='http://www.digitalamherst.org/exhibits/show/people/peoples_19c'>Peoples of Amherst</a> gives a very general description of antebellum population growth and links to the 1790 census list from Rootsweb.  The site does not have a time-line, but instead uses tags for decades and centuries.  The <a href='http://eots.omeka.net/'>Eastern Oklahoma Tuberculosis Sanatorium</a> also includes images of the <a href='http://eots.omeka.net/items/show/4'>1930 manuscript census</a> listing patients and staff residing at the sanatorium.

Then I decided to look for sites that use maps to show change over time.  <a href='http://neatline.org/'>Neatline</a> is a suite of Omeka plugins designed by the <a href='http://scholarslab.org/'>Scholars Lab</a> that could help us show how Morningside Heights changed from 1850 to 1920 by allowing us to combine maps, images, and text, and display them dynamically.   Other Neatline features include a time line and the ability to easily upload data in CSV format.  It would be great to upload a CSV file of information on the buildings in neighborhood, including name, height, architect, builder, owner, number of apartments, etc.

I also looked at<a href='http://viewshare.org/'> Viewshare</a>, which is not an Omeka plug in, but which can embedded in an Omeka site.  The website has a great view using the <a href='http://viewshare.org/views/trow/cason-monk-metcalf/'>Cason Monk-Metcalf data set</a>, a collection of funeral home records.
