I am interested in using the archives at Barnard to learn more about the early relationship between Barnard and Columbia, especially as the Morningside Heights neighborhood was changing in the late 19th Century. As an object of study, I have chosen Milbank Hall because it is the oldest building on the Barnard campus. Milbank is three connected buildings, Milbank, Brinckerhoff, and Friske Halls. The structures were designed by Charles RichÂ and built between 1897 and 1898.
