We welcomed Micah Vandergrift from Florida State University to our
  meeting. Micah was in residence at Columbia for the week meeting with colleagues
  in the Center for Digital Research and Scholarship (CDRS) and other units. He expressed
  interest in our project as a model for involving more librarians in digital scholarship.
  Micah is Florida State University's first Scholarly Communication Librarian. He
  manages the institutional repository, works with faculty and has a strong interest
  in the future of academic publishing.

At the meeting, Micah discussed his work at
  Florida State and how they are going about implementing and building services for
  digital scholarship. He pointed out that his long association with the university
  has been advantageous for him – he knows the culture, the faculty, and has been
  successful in anticipating certain needs. He also acknowledged the challenge in
  getting faculty to think about their own research in new ways and how best to make
  them aware of what services are available.

The agenda for the meeting focused on
  updating our project timeline and confirming our meeting schedule through the fall.
  We granted extensions to several deadlines for the design team and the development
  team – recognizing busy work schedules. We are hoping to have the logo refined,
  color selections confirmed, header and footer ready to go by September – which will
  give the development team the necessary content to begin implementation.

We are planning a few site visits to archives in the fall. We hope the first visit will
  be to the Municipal Archives to explore original documents that can help inform
  the history of Morningside Heights.
