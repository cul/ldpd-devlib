Four things learned today, Oct 1, 2013

1. When working in Github: "commit often." Commit every time you've made a substantial change. Each time that you commit, you create a version that can be rolled back to in the future.

2. The description field is Optional when you commit. When you are committing something that might change the character or function of the site however, you should provide a reasonably full description of what you have done and why.

3. The GUI is user friendly but it can only take you so far. At some point we will need to use command language. We will learn more about this later.

4. Github allows you to create a virtual machine inside your real computer.
