As part of the Design team, I am struggling with learning Illustrator. We have been charged with creating a logo for the Developing Librarian Project and the paper and pencil phase was fun. As a team, we agreed on several designs we would like to realize in Illustrator.

Now for Illustrator...it just doesn't work how I think. I was trained in Photoshop and Illustrator is not Photoshop. The difference between <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raster_graphics">raster</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_graphics">vector</a> graphics has been a challenge for me. Trained as an art historian, I see everything as an image so having to think about an aesthetic object as a mathematical expression is foreign to me. It has been helpful to me that others on the team have been able to get their head around this concept. We look forward to sharing our logos soon.
