When thinking about our Morningside project, I find this Omeka site
  from the Champaign-Urbana community inspiring, <a href='http://eblackcu.net/portal/'>eBlackCU</a>.
  The eBlackCU is a collaborative portal on African-American history and culture in
  Champaign-Urbana, Illinois where the University of Illinois is located. The site
  has been built collaboratively with the community to create a local archive of African-American
  history and culture. In particular, I like how you can browse the content by decade.
  There is also a nice range of materials on the site including photographs, moving
  images, oral history, and sound files.
