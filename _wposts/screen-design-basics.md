1. The three fundamental principles of screen design are layout, typography, and color.

2. The still-valid wisdom of the ancients makes the rule of three or the ruler of four probably the best foundation for a good design.

3. The lack of kerning and a limited number of pixels make sans serif fonts usually the best bet for screen reading.

4. Responsive design enables one to design variant displays for different media -- desktop, ipad, cell phone -- by using cascading sets of rules for different screen widths. 5. Bonus thing: the chromatically challenged can get help from a few websites that indicate what the best complementary shades to one's selected tone will be.
