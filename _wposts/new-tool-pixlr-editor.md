I decided to look at free web based image editors and think Pixlr is
  one of the better ones out there. It is not as robust as Photoshop but provides
  most essentials for photo-editing. It also provides function for image design. The
  interface seems to be modeled on Photoshop with easy to find tool set, layer palate
  and drop-down menus featuring image adjustment features, filters and layering options.
  If you are familiar with Photoshop -- you will make good use of other basics such
  as crop tool, blur, dodge, burn, eye-dropper, smudge -- these are all available
  from Pixlr Editor. It is very easy to create a new image, upload an image (easily
  found my image folder) or grab an image from the web.

  In addition, try Pixlr Express
  --a useful tool for simple, one-click adjustments.
