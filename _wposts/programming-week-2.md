Four things learned:

1. In the phrase 'object-oriented programming,' the word 'object' should be construed to mean the data plus the methods information that tell you how the data would like to be used. PHP is an example of object-oriented programming.
2. We can teach ourselves more about using PHP on Lynda.com.
3. It is always crucial to include both the beginning and ending tag in PHP:  `<?php  ?>`
4. We are studying PHP, as opposed to another programming languge, because PHP is the language used in Omeka.
