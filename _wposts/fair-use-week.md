This week marks <strong><a href="http://fairuseweek.org/">Fair Use
  Week</a></strong> in the library world. Fair Use affects all of us as librarians
  and scholars, but especially in the context of this project, as we are delving into
  researching various landmarks and buildings in Morningside Heights. Some of us are
  fortunate in that the published documents and images of our institutions pre-date
  1923 and fall squarely into the public domain, while others (myself included), have
  to understand what constitutes fair use when it comes to newspaper articles, photographs,
  and other items published in 1930 or later. As such, I appreciate all of the freely
  available resources on Fair Use, so I''m sharing two that have been really helpful
  to me:
