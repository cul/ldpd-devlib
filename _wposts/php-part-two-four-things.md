Four things to take away from today's session, PHP part two:

- both built-in and user-defined functions are possible in PHP;
- arrays can contain lists of data;
- there are built-in functions which can sort and output specified data within an array;
- the period is used for concatenation in PHP. Bonus takeaway: apparently programmers love to have long flame wars about what is and isn't Object
  Oriented Programming, and whether it's good or evil!
