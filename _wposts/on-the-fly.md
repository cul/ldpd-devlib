I'm so excited about this project. Librarians are accustomed to learning
  technology on the fly.  We're efficient: copying another page's source code and
  substituting our own content was one way to get things done quickly when there wasn't
  time to build something from the ground up.  It's wonderful to have the opportunity
  to work through a project from start to finish.
