<strong>1. Terms of use statement</strong>

The group discussed and reviewed a terms of use statement that been drafted by Bob and John for the Morningside
  Heights Digital History (MHDH) project site. One minor emendation was agreed upon.
  John and Bob will next send the statement to Rina Panatalony, Director of our Copyright
  Advisory Office, for review.

<strong>2. Checklist of things that need to happen prior to launch date:</strong>

- Our proposed domain name needs to be approved
- Our project site needs to be brought into compliance with
  Columbia University Libraries/Information Services style guidelines (some work from
  our Development Team will be needed here because this involves adding code)
- Individuals need to complete their exhibits
- Interactive map needs to be constructed for site home page (Alex will do this)
- Site needs to be moved to Columbia University Libraries' server (contingent upon first two points
  above)
- A posting should be done to dh+lib, the ACRL Digital Humanities
  blog, in July, announcing the June 30 launch of site

<strong>3. Questions from group</strong>

A future agenda item was identified. At next meeting the editorial
  team should reopen discussion of metadata standards with group, now that group members
  have had more time to work with those standards. The group agreed to stick with
  the June 30 launch date for site. We agreed that a bibliography for the individual
  exhibits or for the site as a whole would not be required for the launch. The appropriate
  sources will be covered in footnotes.
