Today's session was a more general session, focused on forming teams
  to move ahead with the work on the site. Four things that I took away from this
  session:

<p>1. as we move into the "doing" phase of the project, we may perhaps focus the "Four Things" routine on "four things that we did", rather than "four things we learned";</p>
<p>2. Neatline is a stronger tool for humanistic data and approaches than other mapping/timeline tools, as it allows "fuzzier" boundaries and definitions;</p>
<p>3. although it is designed as a plugin for Omeka, Neatline projects can be run "stand-alone", without Omeka, although Omeka still needs to be installed; </p>
<p>4. georectification of maps is a technique to synchronize the visual presentation of different-sized maps in layers, so that key locations line up (more or less). Map Warper from NYPL does this.</p>
