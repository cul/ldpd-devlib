Four things learned in the session today December 17, 2013:

1. Responsive design responds to variability in screen size. The designer can encode multiple sets of instructions based on different screen sizes. These instructions determine how the design will configure itself for each screen size.

2. Overlapping elements are a common feature in graphic and typographical design in a print environment. True overlap is not well suited for Web design because Web design is based on entities with distinct boundaries. Web designs that achieve the appearance of overlap are unstable--that is, the composition will change in unpredictable ways on different browsers or with different screen sizes.

3. Different Web browsers have different protocols for interpreting page encoding. Thus the same page can look different on different browsers and functionality may vary as well.

4. Three key elements of design are: layout, typography, and color.
