My 4 things of note from today's session on Git and GitHub:

- Git is the desktop app (local) and GitHub is the web site (service; shared repository)

- using the command-line version of Git (in the shell) allows for functionality
  which is not offered by the GUI app version

- "Rollback" does not retain a copy
  of the changes FROM WHICH you are rolling back - you need to create a copy, if you
  want to retain that version

- Cloning in Desktop - this allows you to pull down
  a repository from GitHub. However, you will need to be authorized by the owner,
  in order to collaborate and make edits. You can "fork" the project, if you want
  to take control of a copy of the repository, as your own project (although, you'll
  no longer be linked to and participating in the original source repository as a
  collaborator)
