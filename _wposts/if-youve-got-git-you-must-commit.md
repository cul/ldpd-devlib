Today's session with Git/GitHub once again underscored how capriciously
  tools can behave on different workstations. Â We learned a fair amount, but there
  were still many frustrations for various members of the group. What did I learn?

- The difference between Git vs Github
- Once again, evidence of how difficult it is to teach a group with differing levels of technological comfort
- The meaning of the symbols representing changes in text ( e.g., -0,0 +1.1)
- Importance of using descriptive titles for Commits.
- There were many other teaching moments, and we were also shown how to clone repositories, but I'm
  not sure we (well, I) necessarily understood how it actually functions.
