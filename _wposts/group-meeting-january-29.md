__New Appointments__

John and I met with Alex to discuss new appointments for Design Team members as the work of this group is winding down. Anice will move to the Editorial Team. Sarah will fully focus on Development Team. Karen was away -- we will consult with her on new post shortly. Due to scheduling conflicts, we discussed a new role for Nick. He will assist with staying on top of discussion regarding Omeka.

__Presentation of Design__

Alex presented the work of the Design Team. The team has been hard at work creating our “front page.” See previous post that outlines the process. Overall, the group was delighted with the map, logo, and title. We did not agree on the color palette. Some felt the colors too strong (mix of red and yellow). There was also concern about changing the color of the map. John noted that we are using a historical map for a history research project and we should stay true to the original color palette. There was group consensus to ask Design Team to come back with a subtler color palette.

__Development Team__

Because of the inclement weather and the rare closing of the university, Development Team had to postpone the migration to the newer version of Omeka. The migration was completed on February 9. We have received the go ahead to begin working on the site. We are still working out backup procedures so best advice – everyone should keep backups of the text for exhibit pages in Microsoft Word or Google Drive.

__Schedule for Duration of Phase One__

We will continue to meet every two weeks alternating between presentation/updates and a workshop model to provide time for all members of the group to work on their exhibits. We believe that providing time to workshop together will encourage collaborative learning.
