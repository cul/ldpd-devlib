<strong>1. Review of Map</strong>

Project about development of Morningside Heights - historic map is more powerful because of historical context. Not all locations are on current map. Cognitive noise on historic map. Leak and Watts is in foreground.
  Level playing field with newer map. Historical map misleading. Historical map not
  compatible with Neatline. Narrative Ian wrote describes the historic map. Could
  we link from the main page to the historic map via a tab? Design team chose colors
  for the historic map. Phase one of project never intended an interactive map. We
  talked phase 2 having a Neatline interactive map. Several weeks ago Alex offered
  to create an interactive map for his project. Disagree that this map will make the
  site more interactive. Aesthetic and technical issues with this map. Site is about
  building a narrative about Morningside Heights. Preference for historic map that
  pre-dates Columbia. Could we use a static historic map and list institutions on
  the the side? Is it possible to have interactive maps in the exhibits? Could there
  be an interactive map tab with historic map on front page? Could historic map link
  directly to interactive map? Historic map on left with list of exhibits on the right.
  Prototype of this solution by Wednesday, July 8 Use CUL/IS header but with no "My
  Library Account" or "Help" - get rid of Use current logo with historic map Also,
  would like to revisit color and spacing of chapter titles within exhibits
