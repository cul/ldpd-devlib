The research and editorial process is ongoing.  We have developed a working bibliography included below.  In addition, 
  we are available to help members of the team focus on their individual work in the
  broader context of the project.

For instance, we met with one of our participants to discuss and consult on sources in depth about
  Riverside Park.  The issues that we identified were:

1. the development of city parks in general: who they were for, how they were laid out, how they fit into the city landscape, etc.;
2. we located sources on the history of Riverside Park, specifically, including histories,  documents related to Park, contemporary discussions of it, pictures of it, etc.;
3. the focus has been to put the selected items in the context of city planning, public services, and clientele.
