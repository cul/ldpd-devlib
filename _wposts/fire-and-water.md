On the southwest corner of 113th and Amsterdam stand two of the older
  buildings in Morningside Heights:  the Croton Aqueduct 113th Street gatehouse (1876) 
  and the  <a href="http://neighborhoodpreservationcenter.org/db/bb_files/77-FIREENGINECO47.pdf">Engine
  Company No. 47 firehouse </a>(1890).   I am researching  the role that the aqueduct
  and the fire department played in the early development of the neighborhood.

My first question:  How did the masonry conduit of the old Croton Aqueduct cross Asylum
  Ridge before it was replaced by underground pipes in the 1870s?  Did the conduit
  block streets here, as it did ten blocks south, in <a href="http://collections.mcny.org/Collection/Croton%20Aqueduct%20at%20Glendinning%20Valley-2F3XC58EG2IY.html">Clendining
  Valley</a>?
