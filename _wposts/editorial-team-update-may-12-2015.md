The Editorial Team (Nick Patterson and Anice Mills) led a discussion of Dublin Core requirements for the Morningside Heights Digital History project. We reviewed the metadata fields as defined by Omeka: <a href="https://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core">https://omeka.org/codex/Working_with_Dublin_Core</a> and also looked at a variety of Omeka exhibits to see how they have defined and used the Dublin Core fields, ranging from a minimal description of an item to the more complex. The example sites we looked at:

<p>
Lincoln at 200, <a href="http://publications.newberry.org/lincoln/">http://publications.newberry.org/lincoln/</a><br />
Bard Graduate Center, Craft Art Design, <a href="http://www.bgccraftartdesign.org/">http://www.bgccraftartdesign.org/</a><br />
North Carolina Exploring Culture and Heritage, <a href="http://www.ncecho.org/">http://www.ncecho.org/</a><br />
Digital Culture of Metropolitan New York, <a href="http://dcmny.org/">http://dcmny.org/</a>
</p>

Following a group discussion, we arrived at the 10 required Dublin Core fields we
  plan to use to describe items in our MHDH exhibit. These will be used for search
  capability and the documentation of items in our collections. We decided to use
  these elements for now, with the caveat that we can revisit and adjust these as
  questions arise while we are developing our projects. We’ve renamed “Date” to “Date
  Created.” There was some question of how this will affect items where the date created
  may differ from the publication date. As we proceed with the project we may revisit
  this decision. We also decided to create a custom-defined field named “Decade” for
  search functionality.

Our 10 Dublin Core fields are:
Title; Subject; Description; Creator; Source; Publisher; Date Created;  Rights; Type; Decade.

We also agreed to add tags to our items, which are not Dublin Core elements, and which we can edit
  and review at a later date.
