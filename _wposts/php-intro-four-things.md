The PHP intro was great. It's exciting to begin to dig into the code!

Four things I took away from this session:

- PHP runs on the server, and can generate HTML/CSS/JS to feed back to the page in the browser

- calculations and conditional operations are possible

- PHP code is embedded within an HTML document, between the tags <?php and ?>

- there is a proprietary equivalent from Microsoft, which you can see in pages ending in .asp
