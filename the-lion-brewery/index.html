            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>Several years ago, when I was a new librarian, the Humanities and History
  Division went on a field trip to the 42nd Street branch of the New York Public Library. 
  We were shown around and given in-depth tours of the <a title="Milstein Division,   NYPL" href="http://www.nypl.org/milstein">Milstein Division
  of US History, Local History and Genealogy</a>, as well as the <a title="Map Division" href="http://www.nypl.org/locations/schwarzman/map-division">Map
  Division</a>.  Matt Knutzen, the Map Librarian, had pulled out a wealth of historical
  maps for us, including some of Morningside Heights before Columbia’s arrival. 
  There was one map that indicated property ownership, and it was then that I noticed
  the Lion Brewery, just east southeast of where the university now stands.</p>

<p>I remember wondering which came first: the Lion Brewery, or the Columbia Lions?  It was a question
  that niggled at the back of my mind all these years, without my ever doing a thing
  about investigating it–but when it came time to choose a building to research,
  the brewery was the first thing that occurred to me.</p>

<p>The Lion Brewery was a massive operation, spanning two uptown and one crosstown block.  In a December 1891 article
  in <em>The Evening World</em>, describing the $82.45 that brewery employees raised
  for the newspaper’s Christmas-tree fund, the address is given merely as 109th Street
  and 9th Avenue (now Columbus).  The brewery proprietor at the time was a Mr Simon
  E Bernheimer, of Bernheimer &amp; Schmid, but by July 1903, <em>The Evening World</em>
  was reporting that Mrs Josephine Schmid was buying out her partners, the Bernheimer
  brothers, to become the sole proprietor of the brewery, then valued at $5,000,000
  and producing half a million barrels of beer a year.  Mrs Schmid owned fifty saloons,
  and was known as the ‘Brewery Queen;’ the Lion Brewery was then the second largest
  brewery in the east.</p>

<p>The brewery was adjoined by Lion Brewery Park, which spread from 107th to 108th Streets along Columbus Avenue (more details on the Park to come,
  I hope).  An 1859 article in <em>The New York Times</em>, about a large fire at
  the brewery, claims it was built two years earlier.</p>

<p>The fire was not the brewery’s only brush with drama.  In 1865, a murder occurred in the Lion Brewery Park, during
  a picnic held by the Manhattanville Church of the Annuciation. In 1908, Mrs Schmid’s
  daughter filed suit against her mother for her share of the profits as set out in
  the late Mr Schmid’s will.  In November 1921, an explosion in an ‘ammonia refrigerating
  pipe’ on the second floor of the brewery blew out every window on the floor as
  well as some in neighboring buildings.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning more!</p>

		<p class="author-bio">
			Karen Green has worked at the Columbia University Libraries as librarian for Ancient & Medieval History since 2002, and has been the Graphic Novels librarian since 2005. In 2015, she also became adjunct curator for Comics and Cartoons in Columbia’s Rare Book & Manuscript Library. She has a B.A. from NYU in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, an M.A. and M.Phil. from Columbia University in Medieval History, and an M.L.I.S. from Rutgers University. Karen believes that no one is defined by the relatively narrow set of interests that constitute their official job responsibilities (evidenced, at the very least, by her expansion into comics three years into her job at Columbia). Having lived in New York City since 1978, and loved the city since first visiting in 1969, she is particularly excited by the historical exploration that drives the Morningside Project. Her subject of inquiry is the Lion Brewery, once situated on Columbus Avenue between 107th and 109th Streets, a choice driven in part by her fifteen years as a bartender in NYC (1978-1993).<a class="author-link" href="/author/klg19" rel="author"> View all posts by Karen Green</a>
