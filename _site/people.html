  <p>Karen Green has worked at the Columbia University Libraries as librarian for Ancient &amp; Medieval History since 2002, and has been the Graphic Novels librarian since 2005. In 2015, she also became adjunct curator for Comics and Cartoons in Columbia&#8217;s Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library. She has a B.A. from NYU in Medieval and Renaissance Studies, an M.A. and M.Phil. from Columbia University in Medieval History, and an M.L.I.S. from Rutgers University. Karen believes that no one is defined by the relatively narrow set of interests that constitute their official job responsibilities (evidenced, at the very least, by her expansion into comics three years into her job at Columbia). Having lived in New York City since 1978, and loved the city since first visiting in 1969, she is particularly excited by the historical exploration that drives the Morningside Project. Her subject of inquiry is the Lion Brewery, once situated on Columbus Avenue between 107th and 109th Streets, a choice driven in part by her fifteen years as a bartender in NYC (1978-1993).</p>

I have strong interests in the intersection of music and technology, the history of electronic music, and sound in the digital humanities. New York&#8217;s, and Columbia&#8217;s, musical riches mean that I will probably never leave this city.

  <p>Now Columbia&#8217;s Digital Humanities Librarian and formerly Head of the its Electronic Text Service, I am excited by the potential of a new wave of tools and techniques for finally realizing the promise of the digital format for humanities scholarship. My own academic interests lie in the history and culture of Eastern Europe, particularly in the Middle Ages, but I look forward to applying my desire for better tools to share and analyze historical sources in that field to the more immediate focus of the history of Morningside Heights. For the Morningside project, I bringing together sources illustrating the history of the Bloomingdale Asylum, which occupied the land that is now the main campus of Columbia from 1821 to 1894.</p>
